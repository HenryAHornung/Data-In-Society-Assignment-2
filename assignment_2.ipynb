There\\u2019s plenty worse than me. There\\u2019s men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them. You\\u2019re lying. Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open. Is that the Blackwater? The Blackwater? Where do you think I\\u2019m taking you? Back to King\\u2019s Landing, to Joffrey and the Queen. Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the Queen. That\\u2019s the Red Fork. I\\u2019m taking you to the Twins. But why? Your mother and brother will be there, and they\\u2019ll pay me for you. Why would they be at the Twins? Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in, and we might just make it there in time for the wedding. Men who fight for gold have neither honour nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted. They can be trusted to kill you if they\\u2019re well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well. You know these men? Only by the broken swords on their banners. They\\u2019re called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, the Titan\\u2019s Bastard. Is he more titan or bastard? He\\u2019s a dangerous man, Khaleesi. They all are. How many? ,, Your Grace. Armoured and mounted. Enough to make a difference? It\\u2019s hard to collect wages from a corpse. I\\u2019m sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side. I imagine you\\u2019re right. I\\u2019d like to talk to the Titan\\u2019s Bastard about winning. He may not agree to meet. He will. A man who fights for gold can\\u2019t afford to lose to a girl. Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons, Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and, um\\u2026 Daario Naharis. You are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys. Mind your tongue. Why? I didn\\u2019t mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it. You, slave girl, bring wine. We have no slaves here. You\\u2019ll all be slaves after the battle, unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero\\u2019s lap, and I may give you my Second Sons. Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons? Under ,, Your Grace. We have more, don\\u2019t we? , Unsullied. I\\u2019m only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us. I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have , Unsullied. You\\u2019re very young to be a captain. He\\u2019s not a captain. He\\u2019s a lieutenant. Even if your numbers are right, the odds don\\u2019t favour your side. The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won. The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run. Or you could fight for me. We\\u2019ve taken the slavers\\u2019 gold. We fight for Yunkai. I would pay you as much and more. Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again. Ride with me and you\\u2019ll never need another contract. You\\u2019ll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms. You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry. A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide. Show me your cunt. I want to see if it\\u2019s worth fighting for. My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you? These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you\\u2019d like a flagon to help you ponder. Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink? A barrel, then. Good. The Titan\\u2019s Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we\\u2019ll all share you. I\\u2019ll come looking for you when this is over. Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first. Gladly, Your Grace. Half Robert, half lowborn. Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I\\u2019ll come visit you soon. What do you mean to do with him? You know. Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don\\u2019t torture the boy. Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king? No. If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavour. You\\u2019ve slaughtered many lambs? And none have seen the blade. \\u201cAnd though \\u201cVisenya \\u201cTargaryen \\u201crode \\u201cVhagar \\u201cVhag\\u2026 \\u201d Fuck me. \\u201cVisenya Targaryen \\u201crode Vhagar, \\u201cthe smallest of the dragons, \\u201cthough still \\u201clarge \\u201cenough \\u201cto swallow a horse whole. \\u201d Your Grace. They feeding you enough? Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain. You don\\u2019t belong in a place like this. Well, it\\u2019s sad to say, but I\\u2019ve seen worse. Yeah. I\\u2019m sorry about your son. Didn\\u2019t get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad. Melisandre\\u2019s returned. I didn\\u2019t know she\\u2019d been gone. Came back with a bastard boy. Robert\\u2019s bastard boy. Why? She says there\\u2019s power in king\\u2019s blood. She\\u2019s going to kill him. Sacrifice him. Forgive me, Your Grace, I\\u2019m not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew. What of it? We\\u2019re at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night? Because he has your blood in his veins. So did Renly. Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He\\u2019s an innocent. How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women? The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What\\u2019s one bastard boy against a kingdom? Your Grace, why did you come to see me today? I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again. I swear it. I can\\u2019t swear never to speak against her. You have little regard for your own life. Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I\\u2019d counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You\\u2019re not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five, he said to me, \\u201cI don\\u2019t ever want to die. \\u201d I wanted to say to him, \\u201cYou won\\u2019t, child. You won\\u2019t ever. \\u201d I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the Gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night. I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it\\u2019s right there in front of you, as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real? That dragon bitch. She talks too much. You talk too much. She won\\u2019t talk so much when she\\u2019s choking on my cock. , Unsullied stand between her and your cock. My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can\\u2019t reach? She\\u2019ll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me. Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn\\u2019t like whores. I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I\\u2019m no whore, my friend. She sells her sheath, and you sell your blade. What\\u2019s the difference? I fight for beauty. For beauty? We fight for gold. The Gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die, the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you. You\\u2019ll die young. What do we do about the dragon girl? We can\\u2019t beat , Unsullied on the battlefield. There won\\u2019t be a battle, and we don\\u2019t have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her. She\\u2019s wellguarded. Tonight\\u2019s a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights. Which one of us? Close your eyes, love. Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking. Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I\\u2019m right here. You have something for me? Valar Morghulis. Lady Sansa. You look very handsome, my lord. Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark\\u2019s handmaiden? My lady, I want you to know I didn\\u2019t ask for this. I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord. No, don\\u2019t. You don\\u2019t have to speak to me as a prisoner any more. You won\\u2019t be a prisoner after today. You\\u2019ll be my wife. I suppose that\\u2019s a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say\\u2026 I\\u2019m just trying to say, very badly\\u2026 I just\\u2026 Just want to say I know how you feel. I doubt that very much, my lord. You\\u2019re right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel. But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won\\u2019t ever hurt you. Do you drink wine? When I have to. Well, today you have to. You look radiant, Your Grace. Radiant? Why radiant? It\\u2019s the word that came to mind. We\\u2019re going to be sisters soon. We should be friends. You\\u2019re a musical girl, aren\\u2019t you? I imagine you have a lovely voice. A better dancer than a singer, I\\u2019m afraid. But you know the song The Rains of Castamere? Of course. They play it so often here at court. So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere? Not as well as you, I\\u2019m sure. House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren\\u2019t the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now? Ambitious climbers don\\u2019t want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you\\u2019d see further than all the rest. You\\u2019d be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now? Gone. Gone. A gentle word. Why not say \\u201cslaughtered\\u201d? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword. I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. \\u201cAnd now the rains weep o\\u2019er their halls, and not a soul to hear. \\u201d If you ever call me \\u201csister\\u201d again, I\\u2019ll have you strangled in your sleep. What are you doing? Your father\\u2019s gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband. You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection. Uh\\u2026 Could you\\u2026 Thank you. Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever. Have you ever seen one like it? I\\u2019ve never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life. It\\u2019s shocking, isn\\u2019t it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it. In Flea Bottom we called them \\u201cbowls of brown. \\u201d We\\u2019d pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn\\u2019t chicken. Here, taste this. You think I\\u2019m trying to poison you? That\\u2019s good. That\\u2019s really good. Where do you think it\\u2019s from? I couldn\\u2019t even guess. Doesn\\u2019t matter, does it? It\\u2019s the real thing or it\\u2019s not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don\\u2019t trust it. You think this is all a mistake that you have to pay for every bite you take. That thought had crossed my mind, yeah. There are no mistakes. Not for us. I\\u2019m a mistake. I\\u2019m only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern. Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can\\u2019t even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We\\u2019re both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us. I don\\u2019t understand. This\\u2026 This doesn\\u2019t seem very religious. According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and driedup cunts? What have their gods done for you? Mmm? When you pray to them, what\\u2019s their answer? A god is real or he\\u2019s not. You only need eyes to see. Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I. Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me. What are you doing? You have to trust me. What\\u2026 Get it away. Get it off me. Don\\u2019t fight, don\\u2019t fight. They won\\u2019t take much. Why are you doing this? I told you there\\u2019s power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood. No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there! You can blame Ser Davos. He didn\\u2019t believe in the power of king\\u2019s blood. He wanted a demonstration. Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord! The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. So their son will be your nephew. After you\\u2019re wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the King\\u2019s stepfather and brotherinlaw. When you marry the King, Joffrey\\u2019s mother will become his sisterinlaw and your son will be Loras\\u2019 nephew? Grandson? I\\u2019m not sure. But your brother will become your fatherinlaw. That much is beyond dispute. Will you pardon me, my lord? Of course. Of course. Enjoy. Perhaps you could talk to your bridetobe instead. I\\u2019ve got a lifetime for that. Stay. You seem rather drunk. Rather less than I plan to be. Isn\\u2019t it a man\\u2019s duty to be drunk at his own wedding? This isn\\u2019t about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible. And? If you\\u2019re going to give her one, you need to perform. What did you once call me? A drunken little lustfilled beast. More than once. There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit. You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty. Well\\u2026 My father once told me\\u2026 Nobody cares what your father once told you. Congratulations, my lady. Thank you, Your Grace. Well, you\\u2019ve done it. You\\u2019ve married a Lannister. Soon you\\u2019ll have a Lannister baby. It\\u2019s a dream come true for you, isn\\u2019t it? What a glorious day. Yes, Your Grace. I suppose it doesn\\u2019t really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I\\u2019ll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How\\u2019d you like that? You wouldn\\u2019t? That\\u2019s all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down. Time for the bedding ceremony. Ah! There will be no bedding ceremony. Where\\u2019s your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won\\u2019t be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He\\u2019s not heavy. There will be no bedding ceremony. There will be if I command it. Then you\\u2019ll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock. What did you say? What did you say? I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I\\u2019m sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the King. A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won\\u2019t even know I\\u2019m there. Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace. I am. Guilty. But\\u2026 But it is my wedding night. My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife. I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don\\u2019t you agree? Come, I\\u2019ll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood. Is that wise, my lord? Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion. Is that wise, Tyrion? Nothing was ever wiser. Astoundingly long. What? Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly? . Well, talk won\\u2019t make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage. Stop. I can\\u2019t. I could, I won\\u2019t. But your father\\u2026 If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won\\u2019t share your bed. Not until you want me to. What if I never want you to? And so my watch begins. Nineteen? Yes, Your Grace. How can anyone speak languages? It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well. Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope\\u2026 What do you mean, \\u201creasonably well\\u201d? Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh. Drogo said I spoke Dothraki like one born to it. It gave him great pride. Athjahakar. Athjahaka. Athjahakar. Athjahakar. Well, I suppose I\\u2019m a bit out of practice. Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The Gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry. No screaming, or she dies. What do you want? You. Let her go. Don\\u2019t scream, lovely girl. You were sent here to kill me? So why haven\\u2019t you? I don\\u2019t want to. What do your captains have to say about that? You should ask them. Why? We had philosophical differences. Over what? Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them. You\\u2019re a strange man. I\\u2019m the simplest man you\\u2019ll ever meet. I only do what I want to do. And this is supposed to impress me? Yes. Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades? They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine. Will you fight for me? Swear to me. The Second Sons are yours, and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours. You really ought to knock. I brought your breakfast. It\\u2019s getting dark. We could stay here for the night. How hard can it be to build a fire? It doesn\\u2019t matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm. He winked at me before. I doubt it. I saw him wink at me. He blinked. I suppose it\\u2019s a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink. A what? Well, I mean, there\\u2019s no real difference. A wink is on purpose. You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name. Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me? What? No. This is just the way I talk. I\\u2019ll build that fire. Don\\u2019t you think he should have a name? I don\\u2019t know many boys\\u2019 names. Let\\u2019s see, there\\u2019s Duncan, Kevan, Jon\\u2026 Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer. Craster. Uh\\u2026 Yes. Maybe that\\u2019s not\\u2026 Mormont. That\\u2019s a lovely idea, but Mormont\\u2019s a last name. Why is it a last name? Well, it\\u2019s a family name. For instance, I\\u2019m Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly. His name is Samwell Tarly, too? No, Randyll Tarly. Randyll is a handsome name. Please don\\u2019t name him Randyll. Is your father cruel, like mine? Different manner of cruel. Not Randyll, then. Don\\u2019t. Don\\u2019t go out there. I\\u2019ll be back. I just want to look. Go inside. Go back inside. I\\u2019ll\\u2026 It\\u2019s come for the baby. Stay back! You stay back! No, you can\\u2019t have him! No! No!\",\n          \"I\\u2019ve taken your castle. Theon? It\\u2019s Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I\\u2019ve taken Winterfell. I took it. I\\u2019m occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes. Why? To take the castle. You went with Robb. And he sent me back to Pyke. I\\u2019m a Greyjoy. I can\\u2019t fight for Robb and my father both. Where\\u2019s Hodor? I don\\u2019t know. Find the halfwit. My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard. Why? So you and I can go down and tell them how you\\u2019ve yielded Winterfell to me. I won\\u2019t. Yes, you will. I won\\u2019t. I\\u2019ll never yield. We\\u2019ll fight you and throw you out. The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You\\u2019ll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That\\u2019s what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say. Theon. Did you hate us the whole time? I\\u2019ve yielded Winterfell to Theon. Louder. Say Prince Theon. I\\u2019ve yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me. Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit. Farlen, you be silent. Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do. All of you should do as he commands. My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects. Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it\\u2026 Shut up! If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Steady. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn\\u2019t. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she\\u2019s to bring men to Winterfell. You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not? I am. I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens. My lord. My Lord Greyjoy. I see you\\u2019ve finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive. You were here the day I was taken. I\\u2019m the one who took you. What of it? Let me serve you. Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts. It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again. So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up. Step aside. Why? It\\u2019s your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain\\u2019t letting it drown me. You\\u2019ll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days\\u2019 time\\u2026 Greyjoy! We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen\\u2019s Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword. Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes. It grieves me you\\u2019ve less honour than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people. They are not my people. King Robb thought of you as a brother. My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you. Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons. Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home. If he were alive to see this\\u2026 He\\u2019s not. He\\u2019s dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine. I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand. You\\u2019ve served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I\\u2019ll\\u2026 Take him to the cells. Lock him up\\u2026 My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay. I\\u2019ll lock him in a cell until he rots. No, he has to pay the iron price. They\\u2019ll never respect you while he lives. Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death! No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded. The old man couldn\\u2019t keep his mouth shut. I urge you not to make a hasty decision. He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine. He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do. You\\u2019ll address me as Prince Theon or you\\u2019ll be next. Come. No! No! Theon! Rodrik! He who passes the sentence should swing the sword. I\\u2019m begging you. Coward. Stop. Stop! Stop right now! You don\\u2019t give commands any more, little lord. Please, stop this. Please stop him. Hush now, child. I\\u2019m off to see your father. You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please. Any last words, old man? Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost. Theon, please don\\u2019t. Do something! I\\u2019ll do anything, please! No, please stop it! Ghost, stay with us. Ghost! There goes your pet. He\\u2019s not a pet. No, you\\u2019re right, he\\u2019s not. You can\\u2019t tame a wild thing. You can\\u2019t trust a wild thing. Ghost is different. So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you\\u2019ll never know them. Now the wildlings we\\u2019re looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night. I thought you said you couldn\\u2019t know wild things. I said you can\\u2019t. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun\\u2019s up and do their killing when it\\u2019s dark. We could do the same. No, we couldn\\u2019t. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I\\u2019ve lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn\\u2019t see till they were in it. My father always said I\\u2019m of the North. I wasn\\u2019t joking. Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me? No, you don\\u2019t. We\\u2019re at war. We\\u2019ve always been at war. It\\u2019s never going to end \\u2019cause we\\u2019re not fighting an enemy. We\\u2019re fighting the North, and it\\u2019s not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life. I\\u2019ll gladly give my life. I don\\u2019t want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart\\u2019s done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They\\u2019ll never know what you\\u2019ve done. They\\u2019ll never know how you died. They won\\u2019t even know your damn name. But they\\u2019ll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me? I do. You\\u2019re even dumber than you look. It\\u2019s just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we\\u2019ve got a purpose. Come on. We\\u2019ve got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us. Can you read? My lord? Can you read? This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand. My apologies, my lord. I must have\\u2026 Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It\\u2019s the one on this\\u2026 My cupbearer can read better than you. To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance? My lord, I\\u2026 To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have , men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son\\u2019s life at risk again, I\\u2019ll\\u2026 Leave us. Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you\\u2019re about it. Lord Petyr Baelish. Mmm. Give us the room. Clear all this. Lord Tywin. Baelish. Wine? Thank you. What news from the capital? I travelled here directly from Renly Baratheon\\u2019s camp. Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear. So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces. Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel. It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after. You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today? After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers. Yes, yes, yes. The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly\\u2019s death. And Margaery\\u2026 Wants to be queen. Yes, she does. House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson. They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated. More wine for Lord Baelish. If you will allow me to represent your family\\u2019s interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement\\u2026 The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden? They have. Pardon, my lord. It\\u2019s only wine. You would ride there yourself? Tonight, with your leave. I\\u2019ll have an answer by nightfall. That\\u2019ll be all, girl. And what else? On your son Tyrion\\u2019s directive, I met with Catelyn Stark. Why? He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters. Hmm. A girl. A wildling. We could question her. You could. She won\\u2019t answer. I\\u2019ve known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking. What\\u2019s your name? Ygritte. She was reaching for this axe when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she\\u2019ll bury it in your face. I gave you my name. I\\u2019m Jon Snow. You ought to burn them you killed. We\\u2019d need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area? Burn them or maybe you\\u2019ll need those swords again. Our boy here\\u2019s already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass? The free folk. How many? Hundreds and thousands. More than you\\u2019ve ever seen, crow. Why come to the mountains? What\\u2019s in the Frostfangs your king could want? Do you mean to march on the Wall? Do you know who I am, girl? Qhorin Halfhand. Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner? They\\u2019d take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they\\u2019d kill you slow. We have no food for her. Can\\u2019t spare a man to watch her. Can\\u2019t let her go. She\\u2019ll bring Mance Rayder\\u2019s army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it? No. No, I\\u2019ll do it. Come, brothers. We\\u2019ll leave him to it. We\\u2019ll meet you at the top. Don\\u2019t take too long. We\\u2019re deep in their country now. You never killed a woman before, did you? You don\\u2019t need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There\\u2019s secret ways. The crows would never catch us. I\\u2019m as much a crow as they are. Will you burn me? After? Can\\u2019t. Someone might see the smoke. Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I\\u2019ll come back and haunt you. That\\u2019s cold. Go on. Be quick about it. Do it. Bastard, do it! You can\\u2019t do it. We both know it. The sun\\u2019s going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close. I\\u2019ll find them. Call for them. Go on. Call loudly. May the Seven guide the princess on her journey. May the Mother give her health. May the crone give her wisdom. May the warrior give her courage. One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it\\u2019s like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you. You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don\\u2019t cry. I saw you cry. Did you say something, my lady? My little brother cried when I left Winterfell. So? It seems a normal thing. Is your little brother a prince? No. Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog. Hail Joffrey! Hail to the King. Seven blessings on you, Your Grace. Murderer! Bastard! All hail the king. He\\u2019s no king. He\\u2019s a bastard! Please, Your Grace, we\\u2019re hungry. Freak. Get the prince back to the Keep now. Yes, my lord. Come, quickly. Please, Your Grace, give us some food! Bread, Your Grace, please! Who threw that? I want the man who threw that. Find who did that and bring him to me! Hold on! Hold them back! Just kill them! Kill them all! Move. Move! Pull back! Tear him to pieces! What are you doing? I want these people executed! And they want the same for you. Where\\u2019s Sansa? Through the door. Come on. Push hard. Protect the king! Get back! Fall back! Keep him safe! Brotherfucker! Watch out. Hold them back. Hey. Traitors! I\\u2019ll have all their heads. You blind, bloody fool. You can\\u2019t insult me. We\\u2019ve had vicious kings and we\\u2019ve had idiot kings, but I don\\u2019t know if we\\u2019ve ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king. You can\\u2019t\\u2026 I can, I am. They attacked me! They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They\\u2019re starving, you fool. All because of a war you started. You\\u2019re talking to a king! And now I\\u2019ve struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl? Let them have her. If she dies, you\\u2019ll never get your Uncle Jaime back. You owe him quite a bit, you know. Where are you going? You ever been fucked, little girl? Come here. Take some men and go and find the Stark girl. I take my orders from the king. Where? This way. Please! No! No! Please! You\\u2019re all right now, little bird. You\\u2019re all right. We\\u2019ll get you. We\\u2019ll get you. This way. Are you hurt, my lady? The little bird\\u2019s bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage. See to that cut. Well done, Clegane. I didn\\u2019t do it for you. He shouldn\\u2019t make me wait. The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth. I already have a husband. Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful. And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery. I have travelled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery. The Mother of Dragons! Here he comes. Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself. Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself. Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I\\u2019ll have them flogged in the square. Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want. Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want? My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. I fear I\\u2019m no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have. I\\u2019m not asking you for the kingdoms. I\\u2019m asking you for ships. I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another. Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne. Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne? My father sat there, before he was murdered. But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say \\u201ctake the Iron Throne\\u201d? I didn\\u2019t come here to argue grammar. Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army? Not yet. You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros? There are many there that support my claim. When were you there last? I left when I was a baby. So, in truth, you have no allies. The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return. Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you\\u2019ll pardon me. Do you know Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we\\u2019ve met. A shrewd man. For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed\\u2026 The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons. Do you understand? I\\u2019m no ordinary woman. My dreams come true. I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I\\u2019m sorry, little princess. I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it. Yes, my lady, but not with my ships. Who taught you to read? My father, my lord. Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn\\u2019t learning. He couldn\\u2019t make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he\\u2019d heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he? A stonemason. A stonemason who could read? Hmm. He taught himself. Quite a man. What killed him? Loyalty. You\\u2019re a sharp little thing, aren\\u2019t you? Did\\u2026 Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn\\u2019t ask questions. No. But you\\u2019ve already begun. Did you know your father, my lord? I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old. He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I\\u2019m cold. I\\u2019ll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord. Mmm. Where are you going, girl? The armoury, my lord. Why? Lord Tywin sent me. What might this be? Lord Tywin gave it to me. What for? To take to the armoury. Why would he do that? Let\\u2019s go and ask him. Move! Get out of the way! Amory Lorch. A girl has named a second name. A man will do what must be done. Now! A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time. But he\\u2019s going to tell Tywin. He\\u2019s getting away. It has to be now. Guard! Your Grace. Your Grace. My honour, Your Grace. Your Grace. Your Grace. Quent. Lady Talisa. Your Grace. I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019m a lady. Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me. It\\u2019s hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she\\u2019s a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows. Why are you so sure I\\u2019m of noble birth? Because it\\u2019s obvious. What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother and I lived with him above our shop? I\\u2019d call you a liar. Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty. I always thought I was a brilliant liar. Better at amputations, I\\u2019m afraid. Quite a pretty spot. Will we be here long? I couldn\\u2019t really discuss troop movements with you. I\\u2019m not a spy. Of course, a spy would deny being a spy. You\\u2019re right. You\\u2019ve found me out. I\\u2019m writing a letter to the Lannisters. \\u201cThe young wolf is on the move. \\u201d Perhaps you\\u2019d join me. If you\\u2019ve got time, of course, for, well\\u2026 Robb. Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She\\u2019s been helping with the wounded. She\\u2019s been very helpful. Lady Talisa. Lady Stark. Lady Talisa\\u2026 Maegyr. Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name. An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace. I\\u2019ve missed you. Yes, you look positively forlorn. You surprised me, that\\u2019s all. I didn\\u2019t think I\\u2019d see you today. I wish that you were free to follow your heart. I know. You have inherited your father\\u2019s responsibilities. I\\u2019m afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another. I know. A debt that must be paid. I haven\\u2019t forgotten. Your Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell. Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go. We\\u2019ll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today. Here? There\\u2019s no shelter here. There\\u2019s no shelter anywhere. There is\\u2026 if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire\\u2026 No fire. But a fire is\\u2026 No fire. Have it your way. We\\u2019ll stay warmer if we stay close. Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life. Think they\\u2019re out looking for you? Yes. Think they\\u2019ll find you? Yes. You\\u2019re brave. Stupid, but brave. We start again at first light. Get some sleep. Stop moving. I\\u2019m just trying to get comfortable. Stop it! You\\u2019re still moving. Was I? I didn\\u2019t notice that time. This cannot be true. We\\u2019ve had ravens from White Harbour, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I\\u2019m afraid it is true. Why? Why would Theon\\u2026 Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores. My brothers? We\\u2019ve heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead. I told you, never trust a Greyjoy! I must go north at once. There\\u2019s still a war to win, Your Grace. How can I call myself king if I can\\u2019t hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can\\u2019t\\u2026 You are a king. And that means you don\\u2019t have to do everything yourself. Let me go and talk to Theon. There will be no talk. He will die for this. Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you\\u2019ll lose what you gained. My boy would be honoured to bring you Prince Theon\\u2019s head. Tell your son Bran and Rickon\\u2019s safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I\\u2019ll take his head myself. Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you? I\\u2019m no liar. All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone. I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord. How? And don\\u2019t tell me to put a spear in your hand. There are other ways to serve, my lord. I\\u2019m a prince now, and you\\u2019d do well\\u2026 There are other ways to serve, my prince. Like what? We know things, the free people. You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt? Other things. Savage things. Wait outside. I always wondered what you had under there. It comes at a price. I\\u2019m not killing you. That\\u2019s your price. I already had that. What do you want then, other than your miserable life? What all free people want. My freedom. Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well. Ow! Shh. It\\u2019s not deep. I thought they were going to kill me. They thought so, too. He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me. Of course he did. Why? Why would a stranger\\u2026 You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn\\u2019t matter now. He\\u2019s dead. I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them. Don\\u2019t say these things. If the wrong people hear you\\u2026 But you\\u2019re not the wrong people. Don\\u2019t trust anybody. Life is safer that way. And where are you going? I have something for you from Prince Theon. What? Me. He says I\\u2019m to make the rounds. And keep you warm. The Spice King refuses me because I\\u2019m a bad investment. The Silk King won\\u2019t support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat? When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honourable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets. Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi. Where are they? Where are my dragons?\",\n          \"How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass? Depends if he\\u2019s had any practice. That the sort of thing you and your sister go in for? She loosened you up for us? He\\u2019s going to fall. He\\u2019s going to fall off his horse. Help him. Water. Water. Please, water. Water. Water, please. Please. Please. If I die, you won\\u2019t be getting\\u2026 Oh, enough. Here. Can\\u2019t say that I\\u2019ve ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast. Stop! Far enough. Do that again and I\\u2019ll take your other hand. Come on, you. Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in. I hope we might speak in confidence. Oh. Always in confidence. About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time? Oh, no, it\\u2019s a wonderful time. I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister\\u2019s intentions to\\u2026 End your life? I didn\\u2019t inherit Littlefinger\\u2019s spies along with his position, I\\u2019m afraid. Which is why I\\u2019m coming to you. I need proof. Proof? Will there be a trial? I need to know. I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still? I don\\u2019t know. Do I? As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I\\u2019d heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue, and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror\\u2019s trick? I don\\u2019t know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his red priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts. Yes. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed, which will require a degree of influence, which\\u2026 You do not possess at the moment. But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer\\u2019s purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief, and soon learned that the contents of a man\\u2019s letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the Small Council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world, where I managed to wrap them around something very special. Ugh. The sorcerer. Hello, my old friend. It\\u2019s been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time, if you have the stomach for it. When people talk about the Night\\u2019s Watch, they never mention the shovelling. Or the shit. They tell you about honour, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shovelling really is most of it. And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that. But when you\\u2019re not getting attacked or killed, usually you\\u2019re shovelling. Ah, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of me day. We need to get out of here. When the Lord Commander says we go, we go. The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How\\u2019d that turn out for us? He had no way of knowing. We do now. We know what\\u2019s out there. Craster\\u2019s been out here surviving. So he\\u2019s your new protector now? Our good friend Craster? We\\u2019re like the sons he never had. Mormont isn\\u2019t gonna save you. This lummox here isn\\u2019t gonna save you. When the Walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live, we\\u2019ll have to look out for ourselves. You woke him. I\\u2019m sorry. He\\u2019s beautiful. Shh! He\\u2019s beautiful. Does he have a name? No. Are you going to give him one? Why? Here. Gilly. You said to hold it for you until you came back. You\\u2019re back. I wanted you to have it. I don\\u2019t want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby\\u2019s life. Can you do that? Can you? I don\\u2019t have time for you. I don\\u2019t have time for anyone but him because he doesn\\u2019t have much time. You have to go after him. How? You know how. Brandon. Mother. How many times have I told you? No climbing. Mother, I need to find it. It\\u2019s here. It\\u2019s calling me. I want you to promise me. No more climbing. Promise me. Promise me! Promise me! Mother! Mother! Promise me, Bran! Promise me! Is he very large? No larger than usual, apparently. And yet, they said that he was\\u2026 Extraordinary. The most extraordinary man they\\u2019ve ever had. And they\\u2019ve had a lot of men. We\\u2019re talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion\\u2019s service? Seems a bit simple? What did he do to them? I don\\u2019t know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive. So what did they say? They said it was hard to describe. Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income? He was too preoccupied to notice. He\\u2019s leaving for the Eyrie soon. I\\u2019m helping him prepare for his journey. Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark? He hasn\\u2019t spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. Hmm. But I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019s lost interest. What makes you say so? His shipboard inventory. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession. Former profession. Of course. I\\u2019m missing something obvious you\\u2019re about to point out? Two featherbeds. He\\u2019s bringing two featherbeds for the cabin. Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed, besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls? He\\u2019s not interested in them, my lord. How do you know? Because I\\u2019m one of his girls. Prodigies in odd places indeed. Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather, his dragon. It ate her while her son watched. What\\u2019s left of her is buried in the crypts right down there. The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats comfortably. There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else. There aren\\u2019t more than people of any importance. No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats. Over there, in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. Aerion Brightflame, they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon. He was wrong. And, of course, there\\u2019s the Mad King, killed by my uncle. Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried? Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn\\u2019t find all this a bit macabre? No, it\\u2019s quite all right, Your Grace. I\\u2019d love to see their tombs, really. It\\u2019s like taking a walk through history. The tomb\\u2019s just up here. This is so exciting. You were married here, Your Grace? Yes. Must seem like only yesterday. Hmm. Seems like a lifetime ago. Your husband was buried here as well? No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm\\u2019s End. Such a tragedy. A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don\\u2019t mix. I should say not. My son\\u2019s a hunter. It helps him forget he\\u2019s never been within a mile of a real battle. I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm\\u2019s End for the better part of a year. All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent. I told him to stay out of Robert\\u2019s Rebellion. He had no business fighting an actual warrior. We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave. But they do seem to yearn for it. We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off, like rain off a wing. And yet the world belongs to them. A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind. The Gods have seen fit to make it so. My father didn\\u2019t want them here. He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise. I\\u2019m glad he did. I\\u2019m sorry, Your Grace. I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this. Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness. I couldn\\u2019t agree more. Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousand fold. I\\u2019ve spoken with them. I know how they feel about you. You led the defence of King\\u2019s Landing. They adore you. Open the doors. Joffrey. Wait. Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery! Bless you, Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery! Margaery! Long live Lady Margaery! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! Gods bless King Joffrey! How far is it to Deepwood Motte? Not far, my lord. Your sister is waiting for you there. She sent you to save me? Yes. I served them, the men who were torturing you. I did what they told and waited. Why would you risk your life for me? I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord. I was only a boy when they took you away. My father brought us up to the bluffs so we could watch you carried off. I remember the look on my father\\u2019s face when he told us, \\u201cThat\\u2019s Balon Greyjoy\\u2019s last living son. \\u201d And those are the words I heard over again when I saw what they were doing to you. Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me. Did he? I don\\u2019t know, my lord. They\\u2026 They never told me much. My sister\\u2019s men are loyal to her. We don\\u2019t need to hide from them. Not all those are your sister\\u2019s men. Some of them are loyal to your father. Hmm. What is it? I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place. What did he tell you to do? Raid fishing villages. He didn\\u2019t trust me. Thought I was a Stark. I could never be a Stark. Robb Stark always reminded me of that. He lorded it over you? Didn\\u2019t have to. All he had to do was be. Be who he was born to be. His life fit him better than his clothes. How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? He\\u2019s the King in the North. And me\\u2026 My father gave me a choice and I made it. I could never be a Stark. But ironborn, that\\u2019s what I was born to be. I paid the iron price for Winterfell. I murdered those boys. The Stark boys? Never found them. Just some poor orphans living with a farmer. I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies, so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud. Maybe it\\u2019s not too late. It is. My real father lost his head at King\\u2019s Landing. I made a choice, and I chose wrong. And now I\\u2019ve burned everything down. Not everything, my lord. She\\u2019s up here. Yara. Shh! Wait. I brought him back. He\\u2026 He killed the others. What? No, I didn\\u2019t. You can\\u2019t! No! Please, stop! No! Put him back where he belongs. Eat. What are you doing? I\\u2019m dying. You can\\u2019t die. You need to live to take revenge. I don\\u2019t care about revenge. You coward. A little misfortune and you\\u2019re giving up. Misfor\\u2026 Misfortune? You lost your hand. My sword hand. I was that hand. You have a taste, one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them, and you whine and cry and quit. You sound like a bloody woman. I know what you did for me. You told them Tarth was full of sapphires. It\\u2019s called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water. You knew that. Why did you help me? You wanted to speak to me? Yes, about Jaime. What about him? I wanted to make sure we\\u2019re doing everything we can to get him back. When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner, what did I do in response? You started a war. And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir? Whatever you can. Whatever I can. You\\u2019re still here. Yes. Why? Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me. Years and years of lectures on family and legacy\\u2026 The same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations. Did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them, living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children? All right. Contribute. The Tyrells are a problem. The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. The Tyrells saved your life, your children\\u2019s lives. Margaery has her claws in Joffrey. She knows how to manipulate him. Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don\\u2019t distrust you because you\\u2019re a woman. I distrust you because you\\u2019re not as smart as you think you are. You\\u2019ve allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city. Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes. I will. Do you like it, Nana? Another golden rose. How original. I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses. I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear. \\u201cGrowing strong. \\u201d Ha! The dullest words of any house. \\u201cWinter is coming! \\u201d Now that\\u2019s memorable. \\u201cWe do not sow. \\u201d Strong. Strong. Those are houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts. But a golden rose growing strong, that strikes fear in the heart. Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along now. Grow strong. My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King\\u2019s Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence. The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me? A little obvious, perhaps. Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It\\u2019s been so long. Though I rather think it\\u2019s all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers. But you\\u2019ve come mincing all this way for something. So? Might I sit? No. Come, I\\u2019ve heard you\\u2019re such a clever man. I\\u2019m curious why you\\u2019ve sought me out. You\\u2019ve taken an interest in Sansa Stark. Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn\\u2019t I? She\\u2019s an interesting girl. Is she? No, not particularly. But she\\u2019s had an interesting childhood. She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then. I thought we shared certain hopes for her wellbeing. Come, come. You surrender rather easily. Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too. I choose my allies carefully, and my enemies more carefully still. Which is Sansa Stark? Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father. Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head? I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter. How? You\\u2019re not the only one who has taken an interest in her. That\\u2019s hardly surprising. She\\u2019s a beautiful girl with a famous name. Indeed. She\\u2019d make a lovely match for the right suitor. It almost feels as if you\\u2019re about to arrive at the point. Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him. And why have you come to me with this matter? Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army? Perhaps you\\u2019ll laugh, but I know him better than most, and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North. And if he marries her, he\\u2019ll have the key in his pocket. Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride? You must despise him. You\\u2019re working so hard to undermine him. Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes. You are a clever man, Lord Varys. You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution. One doesn\\u2019t need to be clever for that. It\\u2019s obvious, isn\\u2019t it? I didn\\u2019t mean to disturb you. You haven\\u2019t. We\\u2019d like some privacy, please. If you wouldn\\u2019t mind waiting back inside the keep. Or if you\\u2019d be kind enough to give me your names, I\\u2019ll ask the King to speak with you himself. What did you pray for? I can\\u2019t tell you. Why not? I\\u2019ll tell you what I prayed for in the Sept this morning. Let\\u2019s see, for my family\\u2019s health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter. Boring and traditional, I\\u2019m afraid. And you? I\\u2019m sorry, I just can\\u2019t. My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I\\u2019d ever seen. When I was , I was all elbows and knees, and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me. \\u201cPig Face,\\u201d she called me. \\u201cPig Face\\u201d? That\\u2019s ridiculous. It had something to do with my nose. Whenever she passed me in the halls, she\\u2019d oink. So I prayed that she\\u2019d catch a horrible skin disease. A week after that, she came down with porridge plague. Porridge plague? Oh, you don\\u2019t have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats, and eventually, your face slides off and you die in agony. But that\\u2019s awful. You\\u2019re\\u2026 I believed you! Porridge plague. I\\u2019m an idiot. Don\\u2019t say that. No, you\\u2019re not. So what happened to Alanna? Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. It\\u2019s all terribly frustrating. I\\u2019m sure she\\u2019s jealous of you now. You\\u2019ll be married here in the capital, and she\\u2019ll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you\\u2019re queen. I want us to be friends, good friends. That would make me very happy. You must see Highgarden. You\\u2019d love it there. I know you would. We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon. You should see the costumes. People work on them for months. Uh, I don\\u2019t think the Queen would let me leave King\\u2019s Landing. The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I\\u2019ll be queen. And if you were to marry Loras, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn\\u2019t it? We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that? His name was Bannen. He was a good man, a good ranger. He came to us from\\u2026 Where did he come from? Down White Harbor way. He came to us from White Harbor. Never failed in his duty. He kept his vows the best he could. He rode far, fought fiercely. We shall never see his like again. And now his watch has ended. And now his watch has ended. Didn\\u2019t think a broke foot could kill a man. It wasn\\u2019t his foot that killed him. That bastard Craster starved him to death. Craster\\u2019s got his daughters to feed. You on his side? We can\\u2019t just show up and steal all his food. We\\u2019re brothers of the Night\\u2019s Watch, not thieves. The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine, and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow. He\\u2019s a bloody wildling. Never knew Bannen could smell so good. You have one son, don\\u2019t you, Mormont? I had my th. You ever meet a man with sons? And more daughters than I can count. I\\u2019m glad for you. Are you now? Me, I\\u2019ll be glad when you and yours have gone. As soon as our wounded are strong enough. Ah! They\\u2019re as strong as they\\u2019re gonna get. Them that\\u2019s dying, why don\\u2019t you cut their throats and be done with it? Or leave them if you\\u2019ve not the stomach, and I\\u2019ll sort them myself. Whose throat you gonna cut, old man? Wait outside. It\\u2019s cold outside and there\\u2019s nothing to eat. My wives gave you bread. There\\u2019s sawdust in the bread. You don\\u2019t like it, you go out there and eat the snow. I\\u2019d rather eat what you\\u2019ve got hidden away. I told you to wait outside. He\\u2019s sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die. I gave you crows enough. I\\u2019ve got to feed my women! You admit you\\u2019ve got a hidden larder? How else you make it through winter? Enough! Out! I am a godly man. You\\u2019re a stingy bastard! Bastard? Out with you, you little thief. And you! And you! Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies. I\\u2019ll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard. You are a bastard. A daughterfucking, wildling bastard. The Gods will curse us for this. By all the laws\\u2026 There are no laws beyond the Wall. Show us where he hides the food, or you\\u2019ll get the same as him. Unhand her. I shall have your head for this. Quickly. Quickly. What\\u2019s happening? I\\u2019m not going out there. No, we have to go. Now! Follow me. I know the best way. Come on. Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well! I\\u2019ll be cutting your throat one of these nights. Can I take this hood off yet? I do apologise, little lady, but it\\u2019s better for you if you don\\u2019t see where we\\u2019re going. Halt! What is it? Blackstrap rum. Ugh! Not easy finding molasses in wartime. I\\u2019d have some. Let\\u2019s go home. What is this place? Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling. You look like a bunch of swineherds. Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before. You\\u2019re still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier? No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier. Beric Dondarrion? You\\u2019ve seen better days. And I won\\u2019t see them again. Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren\\u2019t fighting in a war, you\\u2019re running from it. Last I heard, you were King Joffrey\\u2019s guard dog. But here you are , miles from home. Which of us is running? Untie these ropes and we\\u2019ll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants? Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert\\u2019s name. Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother\\u2019s alive. You\\u2019re fighting for ghosts. That\\u2019s what we are, ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can\\u2019t see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear, Lannister, Stark, Baratheon, you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood Without Banners will hunt you down. You found god? Is that it? Aye. I\\u2019ve been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who\\u2019s seen the things we\\u2019ve seen. If you mean to murder me, then get on with it. You\\u2019ll die soon enough, dog. But it won\\u2019t be murder, only justice. And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions, you call yourselves. At the Mummer\\u2019s Ford, girls of seven years were raped, and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched. I wasn\\u2019t at the Mummer\\u2019s Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door. House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne. Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime? Murder is a crime. I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelt them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don\\u2019t call me murderer and pretend that you\\u2019re not. You murdered Mycah. The butcher\\u2019s boy. My friend. He was years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer. Aye, he was a bleeder. You don\\u2019t deny killing this boy? I was Joffrey\\u2019s sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince. That\\u2019s a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away. Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes. You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat. So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here? Aye. She might be. But it\\u2019s me you\\u2019ll fight. The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price. And who knows? In years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus, all shall prosper. Is it done, then? They belong to me? It is done. It is done. She holds the whip. You hold the whip. This bitch has her army. Unsullied! Forward march! Halt! Tell the bitch her beast won\\u2019t come. A dragon is not a slave. You speak Valyrian? I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue. Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see! I am your master! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Dracarys. Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":28}],"source":["# Load metadata.\n","metadata_df = pd.read_csv('metadata.csv', sep = \",\")\n","metadata_df.rename(columns={\"FILE\": \"Filename\"}, inplace=True)\n","final_data_df = metadata_df.merge(GOT_df,on='Filename')\n","final_data_df = final_data_df.drop(columns = [\"TEXT\"])\n","\n","final_data_df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xdlHoqlBA_HD"},"source":["## Part 2: Text Enrichment & Processing\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"id":"2P1TUR3oA_HD","outputId":"91b57967-9e67-4737-eb5f-da9d1e8eb175","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732531518617,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1190,"user":{"displayName":"H.A.

You don\\u2019t want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you. There\\u2019s no one worse than you. You never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There\\u2019s plenty worse than me. There\\u2019s men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them. You\\u2019re lying. Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open. Is that the Blackwater? The Blackwater? Where do you think I\\u2019m taking you? Back to King\\u2019s Landing, to Joffrey and the Queen. Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the Queen. That\\u2019s the Red Fork. I\\u2019m taking you to the Twins. But why? Your mother and brother will be there, and they\\u2019ll pay me for you. Why would they be at the Twins? Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in, and we might just make it there in time for the wedding. Men who fight for gold have neither honour nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted. They can be trusted to kill you if they\\u2019re well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well. You know these men? Only by the broken swords on their banners. They\\u2019re called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, the Titan\\u2019s Bastard. Is he more titan or bastard? He\\u2019s a dangerous man, Khaleesi. They all are. How many? ,, Your Grace. Armoured and mounted. Enough to make a difference? It\\u2019s hard to collect wages from a corpse. I\\u2019m sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side. I imagine you\\u2019re right. I\\u2019d like to talk to the Titan\\u2019s Bastard about winning. He may not agree to meet. He will. A man who fights for gold can\\u2019t afford to lose to a girl. Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons, Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and, um\\u2026 Daario Naharis. You are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys. Mind your tongue. Why? I didn\\u2019t mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it. You, slave girl, bring wine. We have no slaves here. You\\u2019ll all be slaves after the battle, unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero\\u2019s lap, and I may give you my Second Sons. Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons? Under ,, Your Grace. We have more, don\\u2019t we? , Unsullied. I\\u2019m only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us. I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have , Unsullied. You\\u2019re very young to be a captain. He\\u2019s not a captain. He\\u2019s a lieutenant. Even if your numbers are right, the odds don\\u2019t favour your side. The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won. The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run. Or you could fight for me. We\\u2019ve taken the slavers\\u2019 gold. We fight for Yunkai. I would pay you as much and more. Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again. Ride with me and you\\u2019ll never need another contract. You\\u2019ll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms. You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry. A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide. Show me your cunt. I want to see if it\\u2019s worth fighting for. My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you? These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you\\u2019d like a flagon to help you ponder. Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink? A barrel, then. Good. The Titan\\u2019s Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we\\u2019ll all share you. I\\u2019ll come looking for you when this is over. Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first. Gladly, Your Grace. Half Robert, half lowborn. Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I\\u2019ll come visit you soon. What do you mean to do with him? You know. Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don\\u2019t torture the boy. Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king? No. If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavour. You\\u2019ve slaughtered many lambs? And none have seen the blade. \\u201cAnd though \\u201cVisenya \\u201cTargaryen \\u201crode \\u201cVhagar \\u201cVhag\\u2026 \\u201d Fuck me. \\u201cVisenya Targaryen \\u201crode Vhagar, \\u201cthe smallest of the dragons, \\u201cthough still \\u201clarge \\u201cenough \\u201cto swallow a horse whole. \\u201d Your Grace. They feeding you enough? Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain. You don\\u2019t belong in a place like this. Well, it\\u2019s sad to say, but I\\u2019ve seen worse. Yeah. I\\u2019m sorry about your son. Didn\\u2019t get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad. Melisandre\\u2019s returned. I didn\\u2019t know she\\u2019d been gone. Came back with a bastard boy. Robert\\u2019s bastard boy. Why? She says there\\u2019s power in king\\u2019s blood. She\\u2019s going to kill him. Sacrifice him. Forgive me, Your Grace, I\\u2019m not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew. What of it? We\\u2019re at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night? Because he has your blood in his veins. So did Renly. Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He\\u2019s an innocent. How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women? The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What\\u2019s one bastard boy against a kingdom? Your Grace, why did you come to see me today? I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again. I swear it. I can\\u2019t swear never to speak against her. You have little regard for your own life. Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I\\u2019d counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You\\u2019re not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five, he said to me, \\u201cI don\\u2019t ever want to die. \\u201d I wanted to say to him, \\u201cYou won\\u2019t, child. You won\\u2019t ever. \\u201d I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the Gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night. I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it\\u2019s right there in front of you, as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real? That dragon bitch. She talks too much. You talk too much. She won\\u2019t talk so much when she\\u2019s choking on my cock. , Unsullied stand between her and your cock. My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can\\u2019t reach? She\\u2019ll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me. Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn\\u2019t like whores. I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I\\u2019m no whore, my friend. She sells her sheath, and you sell your blade. What\\u2019s the difference? I fight for beauty. For beauty? We fight for gold. The Gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die, the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you. You\\u2019ll die young. What do we do about the dragon girl? We can\\u2019t beat , Unsullied on the battlefield. There won\\u2019t be a battle, and we don\\u2019t have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her. She\\u2019s wellguarded. Tonight\\u2019s a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights. Which one of us? Close your eyes, love. Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking. Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I\\u2019m right here. You have something for me? Valar Morghulis. Lady Sansa. You look very handsome, my lord. Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark\\u2019s handmaiden? My lady, I want you to know I didn\\u2019t ask for this. I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord. No, don\\u2019t. You don\\u2019t have to speak to me as a prisoner any more. You won\\u2019t be a prisoner after today. You\\u2019ll be my wife. I suppose that\\u2019s a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say\\u2026 I\\u2019m just trying to say, very badly\\u2026 I just\\u2026 Just want to say I know how you feel. I doubt that very much, my lord. You\\u2019re right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel. But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won\\u2019t ever hurt you. Do you drink wine? When I have to. Well, today you have to. You look radiant, Your Grace. Radiant? Why radiant? It\\u2019s the word that came to mind. We\\u2019re going to be sisters soon. We should be friends. You\\u2019re a musical girl, aren\\u2019t you? I imagine you have a lovely voice. A better dancer than a singer, I\\u2019m afraid. But you know the song The Rains of Castamere? Of course. They play it so often here at court. So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere? Not as well as you, I\\u2019m sure. House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren\\u2019t the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now? Ambitious climbers don\\u2019t want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you\\u2019d see further than all the rest. You\\u2019d be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now? Gone. Gone. A gentle word. Why not say \\u201cslaughtered\\u201d? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword. I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. \\u201cAnd now the rains weep o\\u2019er their halls, and not a soul to hear. \\u201d If you ever call me \\u201csister\\u201d again, I\\u2019ll have you strangled in your sleep. What are you doing? Your father\\u2019s gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband. You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection. Uh\\u2026 Could you\\u2026 Thank you. Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever. Have you ever seen one like it? I\\u2019ve never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life. It\\u2019s shocking, isn\\u2019t it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it. In Flea Bottom we called them \\u201cbowls of brown. \\u201d We\\u2019d pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn\\u2019t chicken. Here, taste this. You think I\\u2019m trying to poison you? That\\u2019s good. That\\u2019s really good. Where do you think it\\u2019s from? I couldn\\u2019t even guess. Doesn\\u2019t matter, does it? It\\u2019s the real thing or it\\u2019s not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don\\u2019t trust it. You think this is all a mistake that you have to pay for every bite you take. That thought had crossed my mind, yeah. There are no mistakes. Not for us. I\\u2019m a mistake. I\\u2019m only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern. Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can\\u2019t even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We\\u2019re both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us. I don\\u2019t understand. This\\u2026 This doesn\\u2019t seem very religious. According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and driedup cunts? What have their gods done for you? Mmm? When you pray to them, what\\u2019s their answer? A god is real or he\\u2019s not. You only need eyes to see. Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I. Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me. What are you doing? You have to trust me. What\\u2026 Get it away. Get it off me. Don\\u2019t fight, don\\u2019t fight. They won\\u2019t take much. Why are you doing this? I told you there\\u2019s power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood. No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there! You can blame Ser Davos. He didn\\u2019t believe in the power of king\\u2019s blood. He wanted a demonstration. Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord! The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. So their son will be your nephew. After you\\u2019re wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the King\\u2019s stepfather and brotherinlaw. When you marry the King, Joffrey\\u2019s mother will become his sisterinlaw and your son will be Loras\\u2019 nephew? Grandson? I\\u2019m not sure. But your brother will become your fatherinlaw. That much is beyond dispute. Will you pardon me, my lord? Of course. Of course. Enjoy. Perhaps you could talk to your bridetobe instead. I\\u2019ve got a lifetime for that. Stay. You seem rather drunk. Rather less than I plan to be. Isn\\u2019t it a man\\u2019s duty to be drunk at his own wedding? This isn\\u2019t about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible. And? If you\\u2019re going to give her one, you need to perform. What did you once call me? A drunken little lustfilled beast. More than once. There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit. You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty. Well\\u2026 My father once told me\\u2026 Nobody cares what your father once told you. Congratulations, my lady. Thank you, Your Grace. Well, you\\u2019ve done it. You\\u2019ve married a Lannister. Soon you\\u2019ll have a Lannister baby. It\\u2019s a dream come true for you, isn\\u2019t it? What a glorious day. Yes, Your Grace. I suppose it doesn\\u2019t really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I\\u2019ll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How\\u2019d you like that? You wouldn\\u2019t? That\\u2019s all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down. Time for the bedding ceremony. Ah! There will be no bedding ceremony. Where\\u2019s your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won\\u2019t be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He\\u2019s not heavy. There will be no bedding ceremony. There will be if I command it. Then you\\u2019ll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock. What did you say? What did you say? I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I\\u2019m sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the King. A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won\\u2019t even know I\\u2019m there. Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace. I am. Guilty. But\\u2026 But it is my wedding night. My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife. I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don\\u2019t you agree? Come, I\\u2019ll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood. Is that wise, my lord? Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion. Is that wise, Tyrion? Nothing was ever wiser. Astoundingly long. What? Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly? . Well, talk won\\u2019t make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage. Stop. I can\\u2019t. I could, I won\\u2019t. But your father\\u2026 If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won\\u2019t share your bed. Not until you want me to. What if I never want you to? And so my watch begins. Nineteen? Yes, Your Grace. How can anyone speak languages? It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well. Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope\\u2026 What do you mean, \\u201creasonably well\\u201d? Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh. Drogo said I spoke Dothraki like one born to it. It gave him great pride. Athjahakar. Athjahaka. Athjahakar. Athjahakar. Well, I suppose I\\u2019m a bit out of practice. Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The Gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry. No screaming, or she dies. What do you want? You. Let her go. Don\\u2019t scream, lovely girl. You were sent here to kill me? So why haven\\u2019t you? I don\\u2019t want to. What do your captains have to say about that? You should ask them. Why? We had philosophical differences. Over what? Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them. You\\u2019re a strange man. I\\u2019m the simplest man you\\u2019ll ever meet. I only do what I want to do. And this is supposed to impress me? Yes. Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades? They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine. Will you fight for me? Swear to me. The Second Sons are yours, and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours. You really ought to knock. I brought your breakfast. It\\u2019s getting dark. We could stay here for the night. How hard can it be to build a fire? It doesn\\u2019t matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm. He winked at me before. I doubt it. I saw him wink at me. He blinked. I suppose it\\u2019s a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink. A what? Well, I mean, there\\u2019s no real difference. A wink is on purpose. You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name. Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me? What? No. This is just the way I talk. I\\u2019ll build that fire. Don\\u2019t you think he should have a name? I don\\u2019t know many boys\\u2019 names. Let\\u2019s see, there\\u2019s Duncan, Kevan, Jon\\u2026 Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer. Craster. Uh\\u2026 Yes. Maybe that\\u2019s not\\u2026 Mormont. That\\u2019s a lovely idea, but Mormont\\u2019s a last name. Why is it a last name? Well, it\\u2019s a family name. For instance, I\\u2019m Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly. His name is Samwell Tarly, too? No, Randyll Tarly. Randyll is a handsome name. Please don\\u2019t name him Randyll. Is your father cruel, like mine? Different manner of cruel. Not Randyll, then. Don\\u2019t. Don\\u2019t go out there. I\\u2019ll be back. I just want to look. Go inside. Go back inside. I\\u2019ll\\u2026 It\\u2019s come for the baby. Stay back! You stay back! No, you can\\u2019t have him! No! No!\",\n          \"I\\u2019ve taken your castle. Theon? It\\u2019s Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I\\u2019ve taken Winterfell. I took it. I\\u2019m occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes. Why? To take the castle. You went with Robb. And he sent me back to Pyke. I\\u2019m a Greyjoy. I can\\u2019t fight for Robb and my father both. Where\\u2019s Hodor? I don\\u2019t know. Find the halfwit. My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard. Why? So you and I can go down and tell them how you\\u2019ve yielded Winterfell to me. I won\\u2019t. Yes, you will. I won\\u2019t. I\\u2019ll never yield. We\\u2019ll fight you and throw you out. The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You\\u2019ll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That\\u2019s what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say. Theon. Did you hate us the whole time? I\\u2019ve yielded Winterfell to Theon. Louder. Say Prince Theon. I\\u2019ve yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me. Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit. Farlen, you be silent. Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do. All of you should do as he commands. My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects. Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it\\u2026 Shut up! If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Steady. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn\\u2019t. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she\\u2019s to bring men to Winterfell. You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not? I am. I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens. My lord. My Lord Greyjoy. I see you\\u2019ve finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive. You were here the day I was taken. I\\u2019m the one who took you. What of it? Let me serve you. Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts. It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again. So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up. Step aside. Why? It\\u2019s your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain\\u2019t letting it drown me. You\\u2019ll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days\\u2019 time\\u2026 Greyjoy! We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen\\u2019s Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword. Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes. It grieves me you\\u2019ve less honour than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people. They are not my people. King Robb thought of you as a brother. My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you. Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons. Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home. If he were alive to see this\\u2026 He\\u2019s not. He\\u2019s dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine. I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand. You\\u2019ve served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I\\u2019ll\\u2026 Take him to the cells. Lock him up\\u2026 My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay. I\\u2019ll lock him in a cell until he rots. No, he has to pay the iron price. They\\u2019ll never respect you while he lives. Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death! No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded. The old man couldn\\u2019t keep his mouth shut. I urge you not to make a hasty decision. He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine. He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do. You\\u2019ll address me as Prince Theon or you\\u2019ll be next. Come. No! No! Theon! Rodrik! He who passes the sentence should swing the sword. I\\u2019m begging you. Coward. Stop. Stop! Stop right now! You don\\u2019t give commands any more, little lord. Please, stop this. Please stop him. Hush now, child. I\\u2019m off to see your father. You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please. Any last words, old man? Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost. Theon, please don\\u2019t. Do something! I\\u2019ll do anything, please! No, please stop it! Ghost, stay with us. Ghost! There goes your pet. He\\u2019s not a pet. No, you\\u2019re right, he\\u2019s not. You can\\u2019t tame a wild thing. You can\\u2019t trust a wild thing. Ghost is different. So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you\\u2019ll never know them. Now the wildlings we\\u2019re looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night. I thought you said you couldn\\u2019t know wild things. I said you can\\u2019t. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun\\u2019s up and do their killing when it\\u2019s dark. We could do the same. No, we couldn\\u2019t. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I\\u2019ve lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn\\u2019t see till they were in it. My father always said I\\u2019m of the North. I wasn\\u2019t joking. Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me? No, you don\\u2019t. We\\u2019re at war. We\\u2019ve always been at war. It\\u2019s never going to end \\u2019cause we\\u2019re not fighting an enemy. We\\u2019re fighting the North, and it\\u2019s not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life. I\\u2019ll gladly give my life. I don\\u2019t want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart\\u2019s done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They\\u2019ll never know what you\\u2019ve done. They\\u2019ll never know how you died. They won\\u2019t even know your damn name. But they\\u2019ll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me? I do. You\\u2019re even dumber than you look. It\\u2019s just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we\\u2019ve got a purpose. Come on. We\\u2019ve got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us. Can you read? My lord? Can you read? This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand. My apologies, my lord. I must have\\u2026 Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It\\u2019s the one on this\\u2026 My cupbearer can read better than you. To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance? My lord, I\\u2026 To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have , men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son\\u2019s life at risk again, I\\u2019ll\\u2026 Leave us. Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you\\u2019re about it. Lord Petyr Baelish. Mmm. Give us the room. Clear all this. Lord Tywin. Baelish. Wine? Thank you. What news from the capital? I travelled here directly from Renly Baratheon\\u2019s camp. Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear. So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces. Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel. It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after. You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today? After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers. Yes, yes, yes. The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly\\u2019s death. And Margaery\\u2026 Wants to be queen. Yes, she does. House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson. They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated. More wine for Lord Baelish. If you will allow me to represent your family\\u2019s interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement\\u2026 The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden? They have. Pardon, my lord. It\\u2019s only wine. You would ride there yourself? Tonight, with your leave. I\\u2019ll have an answer by nightfall. That\\u2019ll be all, girl. And what else? On your son Tyrion\\u2019s directive, I met with Catelyn Stark. Why? He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters. Hmm. A girl. A wildling. We could question her. You could. She won\\u2019t answer. I\\u2019ve known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking. What\\u2019s your name? Ygritte. She was reaching for this axe when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she\\u2019ll bury it in your face. I gave you my name. I\\u2019m Jon Snow. You ought to burn them you killed. We\\u2019d need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area? Burn them or maybe you\\u2019ll need those swords again. Our boy here\\u2019s already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass? The free folk. How many? Hundreds and thousands. More than you\\u2019ve ever seen, crow. Why come to the mountains? What\\u2019s in the Frostfangs your king could want? Do you mean to march on the Wall? Do you know who I am, girl? Qhorin Halfhand. Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner? They\\u2019d take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they\\u2019d kill you slow. We have no food for her. Can\\u2019t spare a man to watch her. Can\\u2019t let her go. She\\u2019ll bring Mance Rayder\\u2019s army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it? No. No, I\\u2019ll do it. Come, brothers. We\\u2019ll leave him to it. We\\u2019ll meet you at the top. Don\\u2019t take too long. We\\u2019re deep in their country now. You never killed a woman before, did you? You don\\u2019t need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There\\u2019s secret ways. The crows would never catch us. I\\u2019m as much a crow as they are. Will you burn me? After? Can\\u2019t. Someone might see the smoke. Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I\\u2019ll come back and haunt you. That\\u2019s cold. Go on. Be quick about it. Do it. Bastard, do it! You can\\u2019t do it. We both know it. The sun\\u2019s going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close. I\\u2019ll find them. Call for them. Go on. Call loudly. May the Seven guide the princess on her journey. May the Mother give her health. May the crone give her wisdom. May the warrior give her courage. One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it\\u2019s like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you. You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don\\u2019t cry. I saw you cry. Did you say something, my lady? My little brother cried when I left Winterfell. So? It seems a normal thing. Is your little brother a prince? No. Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog. Hail Joffrey! Hail to the King. Seven blessings on you, Your Grace. Murderer! Bastard! All hail the king. He\\u2019s no king. He\\u2019s a bastard! Please, Your Grace, we\\u2019re hungry. Freak. Get the prince back to the Keep now. Yes, my lord. Come, quickly. Please, Your Grace, give us some food! Bread, Your Grace, please! Who threw that? I want the man who threw that. Find who did that and bring him to me! Hold on! Hold them back! Just kill them! Kill them all! Move. Move! Pull back! Tear him to pieces! What are you doing? I want these people executed! And they want the same for you. Where\\u2019s Sansa? Through the door. Come on. Push hard. Protect the king! Get back! Fall back! Keep him safe! Brotherfucker! Watch out. Hold them back. Hey. Traitors! I\\u2019ll have all their heads. You blind, bloody fool. You can\\u2019t insult me. We\\u2019ve had vicious kings and we\\u2019ve had idiot kings, but I don\\u2019t know if we\\u2019ve ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king. You can\\u2019t\\u2026 I can, I am. They attacked me! They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They\\u2019re starving, you fool. All because of a war you started. You\\u2019re talking to a king! And now I\\u2019ve struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl? Let them have her. If she dies, you\\u2019ll never get your Uncle Jaime back. You owe him quite a bit, you know. Where are you going? You ever been fucked, little girl? Come here. Take some men and go and find the Stark girl. I take my orders from the king. Where? This way. Please! No! No! Please! You\\u2019re all right now, little bird. You\\u2019re all right. We\\u2019ll get you. We\\u2019ll get you. This way. Are you hurt, my lady? The little bird\\u2019s bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage. See to that cut. Well done, Clegane. I didn\\u2019t do it for you. He shouldn\\u2019t make me wait. The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth. I already have a husband. Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful. And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery. I have travelled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery. The Mother of Dragons! Here he comes. Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself. Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself. Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I\\u2019ll have them flogged in the square. Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want. Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want? My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. I fear I\\u2019m no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have. I\\u2019m not asking you for the kingdoms. I\\u2019m asking you for ships. I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another. Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne. Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne? My father sat there, before he was murdered. But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say \\u201ctake the Iron Throne\\u201d? I didn\\u2019t come here to argue grammar. Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army? Not yet. You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros? There are many there that support my claim. When were you there last? I left when I was a baby. So, in truth, you have no allies. The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return. Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you\\u2019ll pardon me. Do you know Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we\\u2019ve met. A shrewd man. For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed\\u2026 The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons. Do you understand? I\\u2019m no ordinary woman. My dreams come true. I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I\\u2019m sorry, little princess. I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it. Yes, my lady, but not with my ships. Who taught you to read? My father, my lord. Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn\\u2019t learning. He couldn\\u2019t make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he\\u2019d heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he? A stonemason. A stonemason who could read? Hmm. He taught himself. Quite a man. What killed him? Loyalty. You\\u2019re a sharp little thing, aren\\u2019t you? Did\\u2026 Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn\\u2019t ask questions. No. But you\\u2019ve already begun. Did you know your father, my lord? I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old. He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I\\u2019m cold. I\\u2019ll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord. Mmm. Where are you going, girl? The armoury, my lord. Why? Lord Tywin sent me. What might this be? Lord Tywin gave it to me. What for? To take to the armoury. Why would he do that? Let\\u2019s go and ask him. Move! Get out of the way! Amory Lorch. A girl has named a second name. A man will do what must be done. Now! A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time. But he\\u2019s going to tell Tywin. He\\u2019s getting away. It has to be now. Guard! Your Grace. Your Grace. My honour, Your Grace. Your Grace. Your Grace. Quent. Lady Talisa. Your Grace. I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019m a lady. Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me. It\\u2019s hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she\\u2019s a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows. Why are you so sure I\\u2019m of noble birth? Because it\\u2019s obvious. What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother and I lived with him above our shop? I\\u2019d call you a liar. Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty. I always thought I was a brilliant liar. Better at amputations, I\\u2019m afraid. Quite a pretty spot. Will we be here long? I couldn\\u2019t really discuss troop movements with you. I\\u2019m not a spy. Of course, a spy would deny being a spy. You\\u2019re right. You\\u2019ve found me out. I\\u2019m writing a letter to the Lannisters. \\u201cThe young wolf is on the move. \\u201d Perhaps you\\u2019d join me. If you\\u2019ve got time, of course, for, well\\u2026 Robb. Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She\\u2019s been helping with the wounded. She\\u2019s been very helpful. Lady Talisa. Lady Stark. Lady Talisa\\u2026 Maegyr. Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name. An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace. I\\u2019ve missed you. Yes, you look positively forlorn. You surprised me, that\\u2019s all. I didn\\u2019t think I\\u2019d see you today. I wish that you were free to follow your heart. I know. You have inherited your father\\u2019s responsibilities. I\\u2019m afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another. I know. A debt that must be paid. I haven\\u2019t forgotten. Your Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell. Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go. We\\u2019ll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today. Here? There\\u2019s no shelter here. There\\u2019s no shelter anywhere. There is\\u2026 if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire\\u2026 No fire. But a fire is\\u2026 No fire. Have it your way. We\\u2019ll stay warmer if we stay close. Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life. Think they\\u2019re out looking for you? Yes. Think they\\u2019ll find you? Yes. You\\u2019re brave. Stupid, but brave. We start again at first light. Get some sleep. Stop moving. I\\u2019m just trying to get comfortable. Stop it! You\\u2019re still moving. Was I? I didn\\u2019t notice that time. This cannot be true. We\\u2019ve had ravens from White Harbour, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I\\u2019m afraid it is true. Why? Why would Theon\\u2026 Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores. My brothers? We\\u2019ve heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead. I told you, never trust a Greyjoy! I must go north at once. There\\u2019s still a war to win, Your Grace. How can I call myself king if I can\\u2019t hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can\\u2019t\\u2026 You are a king. And that means you don\\u2019t have to do everything yourself. Let me go and talk to Theon. There will be no talk. He will die for this. Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you\\u2019ll lose what you gained. My boy would be honoured to bring you Prince Theon\\u2019s head. Tell your son Bran and Rickon\\u2019s safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I\\u2019ll take his head myself. Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you? I\\u2019m no liar. All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone. I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord. How? And don\\u2019t tell me to put a spear in your hand. There are other ways to serve, my lord. I\\u2019m a prince now, and you\\u2019d do well\\u2026 There are other ways to serve, my prince. Like what? We know things, the free people. You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt? Other things. Savage things. Wait outside. I always wondered what you had under there. It comes at a price. I\\u2019m not killing you. That\\u2019s your price. I already had that. What do you want then, other than your miserable life? What all free people want. My freedom. Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well. Ow! Shh. It\\u2019s not deep. I thought they were going to kill me. They thought so, too. He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me. Of course he did. Why? Why would a stranger\\u2026 You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn\\u2019t matter now. He\\u2019s dead. I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them. Don\\u2019t say these things. If the wrong people hear you\\u2026 But you\\u2019re not the wrong people. Don\\u2019t trust anybody. Life is safer that way. And where are you going? I have something for you from Prince Theon. What? Me. He says I\\u2019m to make the rounds. And keep you warm. The Spice King refuses me because I\\u2019m a bad investment. The Silk King won\\u2019t support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat? When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honourable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets. Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi. Where are they? Where are my dragons?\",\n          \"How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass? Depends if he\\u2019s had any practice. That the sort of thing you and your sister go in for? She loosened you up for us? He\\u2019s going to fall. He\\u2019s going to fall off his horse. Help him. Water. Water. Please, water. Water. Water, please. Please. Please. If I die, you won\\u2019t be getting\\u2026 Oh, enough. Here. Can\\u2019t say that I\\u2019ve ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast. Stop! Far enough. Do that again and I\\u2019ll take your other hand. Come on, you. Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in. I hope we might speak in confidence. Oh. Always in confidence. About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time? Oh, no, it\\u2019s a wonderful time. I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister\\u2019s intentions to\\u2026 End your life? I didn\\u2019t inherit Littlefinger\\u2019s spies along with his position, I\\u2019m afraid. Which is why I\\u2019m coming to you. I need proof. Proof? Will there be a trial? I need to know. I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still? I don\\u2019t know. Do I? As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I\\u2019d heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue, and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror\\u2019s trick? I don\\u2019t know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his red priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts. Yes. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed, which will require a degree of influence, which\\u2026 You do not possess at the moment. But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer\\u2019s purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief, and soon learned that the contents of a man\\u2019s letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the Small Council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world, where I managed to wrap them around something very special. Ugh. The sorcerer. Hello, my old friend. It\\u2019s been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time, if you have the stomach for it. When people talk about the Night\\u2019s Watch, they never mention the shovelling. Or the shit. They tell you about honour, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shovelling really is most of it. And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that. But when you\\u2019re not getting attacked or killed, usually you\\u2019re shovelling. Ah, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of me day. We need to get out of here. When the Lord Commander says we go, we go. The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How\\u2019d that turn out for us? He had no way of knowing. We do now. We know what\\u2019s out there. Craster\\u2019s been out here surviving. So he\\u2019s your new protector now? Our good friend Craster? We\\u2019re like the sons he never had. Mormont isn\\u2019t gonna save you. This lummox here isn\\u2019t gonna save you. When the Walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live, we\\u2019ll have to look out for ourselves. You woke him. I\\u2019m sorry. He\\u2019s beautiful. Shh! He\\u2019s beautiful. Does he have a name? No. Are you going to give him one? Why? Here. Gilly. You said to hold it for you until you came back. You\\u2019re back. I wanted you to have it. I don\\u2019t want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby\\u2019s life. Can you do that? Can you? I don\\u2019t have time for you. I don\\u2019t have time for anyone but him because he doesn\\u2019t have much time. You have to go after him. How? You know how. Brandon. Mother. How many times have I told you? No climbing. Mother, I need to find it. It\\u2019s here. It\\u2019s calling me. I want you to promise me. No more climbing. Promise me. Promise me! Promise me! Mother! Mother! Promise me, Bran! Promise me! Is he very large? No larger than usual, apparently. And yet, they said that he was\\u2026 Extraordinary. The most extraordinary man they\\u2019ve ever had. And they\\u2019ve had a lot of men. We\\u2019re talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion\\u2019s service? Seems a bit simple? What did he do to them? I don\\u2019t know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive. So what did they say? They said it was hard to describe. Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income? He was too preoccupied to notice. He\\u2019s leaving for the Eyrie soon. I\\u2019m helping him prepare for his journey. Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark? He hasn\\u2019t spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. Hmm. But I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019s lost interest. What makes you say so? His shipboard inventory. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession. Former profession. Of course. I\\u2019m missing something obvious you\\u2019re about to point out? Two featherbeds. He\\u2019s bringing two featherbeds for the cabin. Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed, besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls? He\\u2019s not interested in them, my lord. How do you know? Because I\\u2019m one of his girls. Prodigies in odd places indeed. Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather, his dragon. It ate her while her son watched. What\\u2019s left of her is buried in the crypts right down there. The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats comfortably. There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else. There aren\\u2019t more than people of any importance. No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats. Over there, in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. Aerion Brightflame, they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon. He was wrong. And, of course, there\\u2019s the Mad King, killed by my uncle. Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried? Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn\\u2019t find all this a bit macabre? No, it\\u2019s quite all right, Your Grace. I\\u2019d love to see their tombs, really. It\\u2019s like taking a walk through history. The tomb\\u2019s just up here. This is so exciting. You were married here, Your Grace? Yes. Must seem like only yesterday. Hmm. Seems like a lifetime ago. Your husband was buried here as well? No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm\\u2019s End. Such a tragedy. A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don\\u2019t mix. I should say not. My son\\u2019s a hunter. It helps him forget he\\u2019s never been within a mile of a real battle. I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm\\u2019s End for the better part of a year. All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent. I told him to stay out of Robert\\u2019s Rebellion. He had no business fighting an actual warrior. We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave. But they do seem to yearn for it. We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off, like rain off a wing. And yet the world belongs to them. A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind. The Gods have seen fit to make it so. My father didn\\u2019t want them here. He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise. I\\u2019m glad he did. I\\u2019m sorry, Your Grace. I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this. Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness. I couldn\\u2019t agree more. Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousand fold. I\\u2019ve spoken with them. I know how they feel about you. You led the defence of King\\u2019s Landing. They adore you. Open the doors. Joffrey. Wait. Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery! Bless you, Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery! Margaery! Long live Lady Margaery! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! Gods bless King Joffrey! How far is it to Deepwood Motte? Not far, my lord. Your sister is waiting for you there. She sent you to save me? Yes. I served them, the men who were torturing you. I did what they told and waited. Why would you risk your life for me? I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord. I was only a boy when they took you away. My father brought us up to the bluffs so we could watch you carried off. I remember the look on my father\\u2019s face when he told us, \\u201cThat\\u2019s Balon Greyjoy\\u2019s last living son. \\u201d And those are the words I heard over again when I saw what they were doing to you. Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me. Did he? I don\\u2019t know, my lord. They\\u2026 They never told me much. My sister\\u2019s men are loyal to her. We don\\u2019t need to hide from them. Not all those are your sister\\u2019s men. Some of them are loyal to your father. Hmm. What is it? I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place. What did he tell you to do? Raid fishing villages. He didn\\u2019t trust me. Thought I was a Stark. I could never be a Stark. Robb Stark always reminded me of that. He lorded it over you? Didn\\u2019t have to. All he had to do was be. Be who he was born to be. His life fit him better than his clothes. How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? He\\u2019s the King in the North. And me\\u2026 My father gave me a choice and I made it. I could never be a Stark. But ironborn, that\\u2019s what I was born to be. I paid the iron price for Winterfell. I murdered those boys. The Stark boys? Never found them. Just some poor orphans living with a farmer. I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies, so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud. Maybe it\\u2019s not too late. It is. My real father lost his head at King\\u2019s Landing. I made a choice, and I chose wrong. And now I\\u2019ve burned everything down. Not everything, my lord. She\\u2019s up here. Yara. Shh! Wait. I brought him back. He\\u2026 He killed the others. What? No, I didn\\u2019t. You can\\u2019t! No! Please, stop! No! Put him back where he belongs. Eat. What are you doing? I\\u2019m dying. You can\\u2019t die. You need to live to take revenge. I don\\u2019t care about revenge. You coward. A little misfortune and you\\u2019re giving up. Misfor\\u2026 Misfortune? You lost your hand. My sword hand. I was that hand. You have a taste, one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them, and you whine and cry and quit. You sound like a bloody woman. I know what you did for me. You told them Tarth was full of sapphires. It\\u2019s called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water. You knew that. Why did you help me? You wanted to speak to me? Yes, about Jaime. What about him? I wanted to make sure we\\u2019re doing everything we can to get him back. When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner, what did I do in response? You started a war. And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir? Whatever you can. Whatever I can. You\\u2019re still here. Yes. Why? Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me. Years and years of lectures on family and legacy\\u2026 The same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations. Did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them, living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children? All right. Contribute. The Tyrells are a problem. The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. The Tyrells saved your life, your children\\u2019s lives. Margaery has her claws in Joffrey. She knows how to manipulate him. Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don\\u2019t distrust you because you\\u2019re a woman. I distrust you because you\\u2019re not as smart as you think you are. You\\u2019ve allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city. Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes. I will. Do you like it, Nana? Another golden rose. How original. I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses. I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear. \\u201cGrowing strong. \\u201d Ha! The dullest words of any house. \\u201cWinter is coming! \\u201d Now that\\u2019s memorable. \\u201cWe do not sow. \\u201d Strong. Strong. Those are houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts. But a golden rose growing strong, that strikes fear in the heart. Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along now. Grow strong. My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King\\u2019s Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence. The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me? A little obvious, perhaps. Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It\\u2019s been so long. Though I rather think it\\u2019s all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers. But you\\u2019ve come mincing all this way for something. So? Might I sit? No. Come, I\\u2019ve heard you\\u2019re such a clever man. I\\u2019m curious why you\\u2019ve sought me out. You\\u2019ve taken an interest in Sansa Stark. Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn\\u2019t I? She\\u2019s an interesting girl. Is she? No, not particularly. But she\\u2019s had an interesting childhood. She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then. I thought we shared certain hopes for her wellbeing. Come, come. You surrender rather easily. Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too. I choose my allies carefully, and my enemies more carefully still. Which is Sansa Stark? Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father. Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head? I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter. How? You\\u2019re not the only one who has taken an interest in her. That\\u2019s hardly surprising. She\\u2019s a beautiful girl with a famous name. Indeed. She\\u2019d make a lovely match for the right suitor. It almost feels as if you\\u2019re about to arrive at the point. Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him. And why have you come to me with this matter? Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army? Perhaps you\\u2019ll laugh, but I know him better than most, and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North. And if he marries her, he\\u2019ll have the key in his pocket. Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride? You must despise him. You\\u2019re working so hard to undermine him. Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes. You are a clever man, Lord Varys. You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution. One doesn\\u2019t need to be clever for that. It\\u2019s obvious, isn\\u2019t it? I didn\\u2019t mean to disturb you. You haven\\u2019t. We\\u2019d like some privacy, please. If you wouldn\\u2019t mind waiting back inside the keep. Or if you\\u2019d be kind enough to give me your names, I\\u2019ll ask the King to speak with you himself. What did you pray for? I can\\u2019t tell you. Why not? I\\u2019ll tell you what I prayed for in the Sept this morning. Let\\u2019s see, for my family\\u2019s health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter. Boring and traditional, I\\u2019m afraid. And you? I\\u2019m sorry, I just can\\u2019t. My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I\\u2019d ever seen. When I was , I was all elbows and knees, and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me. \\u201cPig Face,\\u201d she called me. \\u201cPig Face\\u201d? That\\u2019s ridiculous. It had something to do with my nose. Whenever she passed me in the halls, she\\u2019d oink. So I prayed that she\\u2019d catch a horrible skin disease. A week after that, she came down with porridge plague. Porridge plague? Oh, you don\\u2019t have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats, and eventually, your face slides off and you die in agony. But that\\u2019s awful. You\\u2019re\\u2026 I believed you! Porridge plague. I\\u2019m an idiot. Don\\u2019t say that. No, you\\u2019re not. So what happened to Alanna? Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. It\\u2019s all terribly frustrating. I\\u2019m sure she\\u2019s jealous of you now. You\\u2019ll be married here in the capital, and she\\u2019ll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you\\u2019re queen. I want us to be friends, good friends. That would make me very happy. You must see Highgarden. You\\u2019d love it there. I know you would. We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon. You should see the costumes. People work on them for months. Uh, I don\\u2019t think the Queen would let me leave King\\u2019s Landing. The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I\\u2019ll be queen. And if you were to marry Loras, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn\\u2019t it? We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that? His name was Bannen. He was a good man, a good ranger. He came to us from\\u2026 Where did he come from? Down White Harbor way. He came to us from White Harbor. Never failed in his duty. He kept his vows the best he could. He rode far, fought fiercely. We shall never see his like again. And now his watch has ended. And now his watch has ended. Didn\\u2019t think a broke foot could kill a man. It wasn\\u2019t his foot that killed him. That bastard Craster starved him to death. Craster\\u2019s got his daughters to feed. You on his side? We can\\u2019t just show up and steal all his food. We\\u2019re brothers of the Night\\u2019s Watch, not thieves. The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine, and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow. He\\u2019s a bloody wildling. Never knew Bannen could smell so good. You have one son, don\\u2019t you, Mormont? I had my th. You ever meet a man with sons? And more daughters than I can count. I\\u2019m glad for you. Are you now? Me, I\\u2019ll be glad when you and yours have gone. As soon as our wounded are strong enough. Ah! They\\u2019re as strong as they\\u2019re gonna get. Them that\\u2019s dying, why don\\u2019t you cut their throats and be done with it? Or leave them if you\\u2019ve not the stomach, and I\\u2019ll sort them myself. Whose throat you gonna cut, old man? Wait outside. It\\u2019s cold outside and there\\u2019s nothing to eat. My wives gave you bread. There\\u2019s sawdust in the bread. You don\\u2019t like it, you go out there and eat the snow. I\\u2019d rather eat what you\\u2019ve got hidden away. I told you to wait outside. He\\u2019s sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die. I gave you crows enough. I\\u2019ve got to feed my women! You admit you\\u2019ve got a hidden larder? How else you make it through winter? Enough! Out! I am a godly man. You\\u2019re a stingy bastard! Bastard? Out with you, you little thief. And you! And you! Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies. I\\u2019ll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard. You are a bastard. A daughterfucking, wildling bastard. The Gods will curse us for this. By all the laws\\u2026 There are no laws beyond the Wall. Show us where he hides the food, or you\\u2019ll get the same as him. Unhand her. I shall have your head for this. Quickly. Quickly. What\\u2019s happening? I\\u2019m not going out there. No, we have to go. Now! Follow me. I know the best way. Come on. Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well! I\\u2019ll be cutting your throat one of these nights. Can I take this hood off yet? I do apologise, little lady, but it\\u2019s better for you if you don\\u2019t see where we\\u2019re going. Halt! What is it? Blackstrap rum. Ugh! Not easy finding molasses in wartime. I\\u2019d have some. Let\\u2019s go home. What is this place? Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling. You look like a bunch of swineherds. Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before. You\\u2019re still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier? No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier. Beric Dondarrion? You\\u2019ve seen better days. And I won\\u2019t see them again. Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren\\u2019t fighting in a war, you\\u2019re running from it. Last I heard, you were King Joffrey\\u2019s guard dog. But here you are , miles from home. Which of us is running? Untie these ropes and we\\u2019ll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants? Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert\\u2019s name. Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother\\u2019s alive. You\\u2019re fighting for ghosts. That\\u2019s what we are, ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can\\u2019t see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear, Lannister, Stark, Baratheon, you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood Without Banners will hunt you down. You found god? Is that it? Aye. I\\u2019ve been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who\\u2019s seen the things we\\u2019ve seen. If you mean to murder me, then get on with it. You\\u2019ll die soon enough, dog. But it won\\u2019t be murder, only justice. And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions, you call yourselves. At the Mummer\\u2019s Ford, girls of seven years were raped, and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched. I wasn\\u2019t at the Mummer\\u2019s Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door. House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne. Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime? Murder is a crime. I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelt them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don\\u2019t call me murderer and pretend that you\\u2019re not. You murdered Mycah. The butcher\\u2019s boy. My friend. He was years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer. Aye, he was a bleeder. You don\\u2019t deny killing this boy? I was Joffrey\\u2019s sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince. That\\u2019s a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away. Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes. You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat. So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here? Aye. She might be. But it\\u2019s me you\\u2019ll fight. The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price. And who knows? In years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus, all shall prosper. Is it done, then? They belong to me? It is done. It is done. She holds the whip. You hold the whip. This bitch has her army. Unsullied! Forward march! Halt! Tell the bitch her beast won\\u2019t come. A dragon is not a slave. You speak Valyrian? I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue. Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see! I am your master! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Dracarys. Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Doc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"I\\u2019ll give you one try, girl.

You don\\u2019t want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you. There\\u2019s no one worse than you. You never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There\\u2019s plenty worse than me. There\\u2019s men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them. You\\u2019re lying. Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open. Is that the Blackwater? The Blackwater? Where do you think I\\u2019m taking you? Back to King\\u2019s Landing, to Joffrey and the Queen. Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the Queen. That\\u2019s the Red Fork. I\\u2019m taking you to the Twins. But why? Your mother and brother will be there, and they\\u2019ll pay me for you. Why would they be at the Twins? Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in, and we might just make it there in time for the wedding. Men who fight for gold have neither honour nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted. They can be trusted to kill you if they\\u2019re well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well. You know these men? Only by the broken swords on their banners. They\\u2019re called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, the Titan\\u2019s Bastard. Is he more titan or bastard? He\\u2019s a dangerous man, Khaleesi. They all are. How many? ,, Your Grace. Armoured and mounted. Enough to make a difference? It\\u2019s hard to collect wages from a corpse. I\\u2019m sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side. I imagine you\\u2019re right. I\\u2019d like to talk to the Titan\\u2019s Bastard about winning. He may not agree to meet. He will. A man who fights for gold can\\u2019t afford to lose to a girl. Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons, Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and, um\\u2026 Daario Naharis. You are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys. Mind your tongue. Why? I didn\\u2019t mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it. You, slave girl, bring wine. We have no slaves here. You\\u2019ll all be slaves after the battle, unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero\\u2019s lap, and I may give you my Second Sons. Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons? Under ,, Your Grace. We have more, don\\u2019t we? , Unsullied. I\\u2019m only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us. I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have , Unsullied. You\\u2019re very young to be a captain. He\\u2019s not a captain. He\\u2019s a lieutenant. Even if your numbers are right, the odds don\\u2019t favour your side. The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won. The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run. Or you could fight for me. We\\u2019ve taken the slavers\\u2019 gold. We fight for Yunkai. I would pay you as much and more. Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again. Ride with me and you\\u2019ll never need another contract. You\\u2019ll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms. You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry. A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide. Show me your cunt. I want to see if it\\u2019s worth fighting for. My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you? These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you\\u2019d like a flagon to help you ponder. Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink? A barrel, then. Good. The Titan\\u2019s Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we\\u2019ll all share you. I\\u2019ll come looking for you when this is over. Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first. Gladly, Your Grace. Half Robert, half lowborn. Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I\\u2019ll come visit you soon. What do you mean to do with him? You know. Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don\\u2019t torture the boy. Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king? No. If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavour. You\\u2019ve slaughtered many lambs? And none have seen the blade. \\u201cAnd though \\u201cVisenya \\u201cTargaryen \\u201crode \\u201cVhagar \\u201cVhag\\u2026 \\u201d Fuck me. \\u201cVisenya Targaryen \\u201crode Vhagar, \\u201cthe smallest of the dragons, \\u201cthough still \\u201clarge \\u201cenough \\u201cto swallow a horse whole. \\u201d Your Grace. They feeding you enough? Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain. You don\\u2019t belong in a place like this. Well, it\\u2019s sad to say, but I\\u2019ve seen worse. Yeah. I\\u2019m sorry about your son. Didn\\u2019t get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad. Melisandre\\u2019s returned. I didn\\u2019t know she\\u2019d been gone. Came back with a bastard boy. Robert\\u2019s bastard boy. Why? She says there\\u2019s power in king\\u2019s blood. She\\u2019s going to kill him. Sacrifice him. Forgive me, Your Grace, I\\u2019m not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew. What of it? We\\u2019re at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night? Because he has your blood in his veins. So did Renly. Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He\\u2019s an innocent. How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women? The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What\\u2019s one bastard boy against a kingdom? Your Grace, why did you come to see me today? I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again. I swear it. I can\\u2019t swear never to speak against her. You have little regard for your own life. Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I\\u2019d counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You\\u2019re not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five, he said to me, \\u201cI don\\u2019t ever want to die. \\u201d I wanted to say to him, \\u201cYou won\\u2019t, child. You won\\u2019t ever. \\u201d I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the Gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night. I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it\\u2019s right there in front of you, as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real? That dragon bitch. She talks too much. You talk too much. She won\\u2019t talk so much when she\\u2019s choking on my cock. , Unsullied stand between her and your cock. My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can\\u2019t reach? She\\u2019ll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me. Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn\\u2019t like whores. I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I\\u2019m no whore, my friend. She sells her sheath, and you sell your blade. What\\u2019s the difference? I fight for beauty. For beauty? We fight for gold. The Gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die, the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you. You\\u2019ll die young. What do we do about the dragon girl? We can\\u2019t beat , Unsullied on the battlefield. There won\\u2019t be a battle, and we don\\u2019t have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her. She\\u2019s wellguarded. Tonight\\u2019s a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights. Which one of us? Close your eyes, love. Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking. Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I\\u2019m right here. You have something for me? Valar Morghulis. Lady Sansa. You look very handsome, my lord. Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark\\u2019s handmaiden? My lady, I want you to know I didn\\u2019t ask for this. I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord. No, don\\u2019t. You don\\u2019t have to speak to me as a prisoner any more. You won\\u2019t be a prisoner after today. You\\u2019ll be my wife. I suppose that\\u2019s a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say\\u2026 I\\u2019m just trying to say, very badly\\u2026 I just\\u2026 Just want to say I know how you feel. I doubt that very much, my lord. You\\u2019re right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel. But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won\\u2019t ever hurt you. Do you drink wine? When I have to. Well, today you have to. You look radiant, Your Grace. Radiant? Why radiant? It\\u2019s the word that came to mind. We\\u2019re going to be sisters soon. We should be friends. You\\u2019re a musical girl, aren\\u2019t you? I imagine you have a lovely voice. A better dancer than a singer, I\\u2019m afraid. But you know the song The Rains of Castamere? Of course. They play it so often here at court. So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere? Not as well as you, I\\u2019m sure. House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren\\u2019t the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now? Ambitious climbers don\\u2019t want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you\\u2019d see further than all the rest. You\\u2019d be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now? Gone. Gone. A gentle word. Why not say \\u201cslaughtered\\u201d? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword. I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. \\u201cAnd now the rains weep o\\u2019er their halls, and not a soul to hear. \\u201d If you ever call me \\u201csister\\u201d again, I\\u2019ll have you strangled in your sleep. What are you doing? Your father\\u2019s gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband. You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection. Uh\\u2026 Could you\\u2026 Thank you. Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever. Have you ever seen one like it? I\\u2019ve never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life. It\\u2019s shocking, isn\\u2019t it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it. In Flea Bottom we called them \\u201cbowls of brown. \\u201d We\\u2019d pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn\\u2019t chicken. Here, taste this. You think I\\u2019m trying to poison you? That\\u2019s good. That\\u2019s really good. Where do you think it\\u2019s from? I couldn\\u2019t even guess. Doesn\\u2019t matter, does it? It\\u2019s the real thing or it\\u2019s not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don\\u2019t trust it. You think this is all a mistake that you have to pay for every bite you take. That thought had crossed my mind, yeah. There are no mistakes. Not for us. I\\u2019m a mistake. I\\u2019m only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern. Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can\\u2019t even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We\\u2019re both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us. I don\\u2019t understand. This\\u2026 This doesn\\u2019t seem very religious. According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and driedup cunts? What have their gods done for you? Mmm? When you pray to them, what\\u2019s their answer? A god is real or he\\u2019s not. You only need eyes to see. Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I. Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me. What are you doing? You have to trust me. What\\u2026 Get it away. Get it off me. Don\\u2019t fight, don\\u2019t fight. They won\\u2019t take much. Why are you doing this? I told you there\\u2019s power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood. No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there! You can blame Ser Davos. He didn\\u2019t believe in the power of king\\u2019s blood. He wanted a demonstration. Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord! The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. So their son will be your nephew. After you\\u2019re wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the King\\u2019s stepfather and brotherinlaw. When you marry the King, Joffrey\\u2019s mother will become his sisterinlaw and your son will be Loras\\u2019 nephew? Grandson? I\\u2019m not sure. But your brother will become your fatherinlaw. That much is beyond dispute. Will you pardon me, my lord? Of course. Of course. Enjoy. Perhaps you could talk to your bridetobe instead. I\\u2019ve got a lifetime for that. Stay. You seem rather drunk. Rather less than I plan to be. Isn\\u2019t it a man\\u2019s duty to be drunk at his own wedding? This isn\\u2019t about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible. And? If you\\u2019re going to give her one, you need to perform. What did you once call me? A drunken little lustfilled beast. More than once. There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit. You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty. Well\\u2026 My father once told me\\u2026 Nobody cares what your father once told you. Congratulations, my lady. Thank you, Your Grace. Well, you\\u2019ve done it. You\\u2019ve married a Lannister. Soon you\\u2019ll have a Lannister baby. It\\u2019s a dream come true for you, isn\\u2019t it? What a glorious day. Yes, Your Grace. I suppose it doesn\\u2019t really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I\\u2019ll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How\\u2019d you like that? You wouldn\\u2019t? That\\u2019s all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down. Time for the bedding ceremony. Ah! There will be no bedding ceremony. Where\\u2019s your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won\\u2019t be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He\\u2019s not heavy. There will be no bedding ceremony. There will be if I command it. Then you\\u2019ll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock. What did you say? What did you say? I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I\\u2019m sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the King. A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won\\u2019t even know I\\u2019m there. Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace. I am. Guilty. But\\u2026 But it is my wedding night. My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife. I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don\\u2019t you agree? Come, I\\u2019ll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood. Is that wise, my lord? Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion. Is that wise, Tyrion? Nothing was ever wiser. Astoundingly long. What? Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly? . Well, talk won\\u2019t make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage. Stop. I can\\u2019t. I could, I won\\u2019t. But your father\\u2026 If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won\\u2019t share your bed. Not until you want me to. What if I never want you to? And so my watch begins. Nineteen? Yes, Your Grace. How can anyone speak languages? It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well. Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope\\u2026 What do you mean, \\u201creasonably well\\u201d? Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh. Drogo said I spoke Dothraki like one born to it. It gave him great pride. Athjahakar. Athjahaka. Athjahakar. Athjahakar. Well, I suppose I\\u2019m a bit out of practice. Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The Gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry. No screaming, or she dies. What do you want? You. Let her go. Don\\u2019t scream, lovely girl. You were sent here to kill me? So why haven\\u2019t you? I don\\u2019t want to. What do your captains have to say about that? You should ask them. Why? We had philosophical differences. Over what? Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them. You\\u2019re a strange man. I\\u2019m the simplest man you\\u2019ll ever meet. I only do what I want to do. And this is supposed to impress me? Yes. Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades? They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine. Will you fight for me? Swear to me. The Second Sons are yours, and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours. You really ought to knock. I brought your breakfast. It\\u2019s getting dark. We could stay here for the night. How hard can it be to build a fire? It doesn\\u2019t matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm. He winked at me before. I doubt it. I saw him wink at me. He blinked. I suppose it\\u2019s a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink. A what? Well, I mean, there\\u2019s no real difference. A wink is on purpose. You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name. Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me? What? No. This is just the way I talk. I\\u2019ll build that fire. Don\\u2019t you think he should have a name? I don\\u2019t know many boys\\u2019 names. Let\\u2019s see, there\\u2019s Duncan, Kevan, Jon\\u2026 Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer. Craster. Uh\\u2026 Yes. Maybe that\\u2019s not\\u2026 Mormont. That\\u2019s a lovely idea, but Mormont\\u2019s a last name. Why is it a last name? Well, it\\u2019s a family name. For instance, I\\u2019m Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly. His name is Samwell Tarly, too? No, Randyll Tarly. Randyll is a handsome name. Please don\\u2019t name him Randyll. Is your father cruel, like mine? Different manner of cruel. Not Randyll, then. Don\\u2019t. Don\\u2019t go out there. I\\u2019ll be back. I just want to look. Go inside. Go back inside. I\\u2019ll\\u2026 It\\u2019s come for the baby. Stay back! You stay back! No, you can\\u2019t have him! No! No!\",\n          \"I\\u2019ve taken your castle. Theon? It\\u2019s Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I\\u2019ve taken Winterfell. I took it. I\\u2019m occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes. Why? To take the castle. You went with Robb. And he sent me back to Pyke. I\\u2019m a Greyjoy. I can\\u2019t fight for Robb and my father both. Where\\u2019s Hodor? I don\\u2019t know. Find the halfwit. My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard. Why? So you and I can go down and tell them how you\\u2019ve yielded Winterfell to me. I won\\u2019t. Yes, you will. I won\\u2019t. I\\u2019ll never yield. We\\u2019ll fight you and throw you out. The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You\\u2019ll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That\\u2019s what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say. Theon. Did you hate us the whole time? I\\u2019ve yielded Winterfell to Theon. Louder. Say Prince Theon. I\\u2019ve yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me. Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit. Farlen, you be silent. Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do. All of you should do as he commands. My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects. Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it\\u2026 Shut up! If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Steady. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn\\u2019t. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she\\u2019s to bring men to Winterfell. You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not? I am. I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens. My lord. My Lord Greyjoy. I see you\\u2019ve finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive. You were here the day I was taken. I\\u2019m the one who took you. What of it? Let me serve you. Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts. It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again. So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up. Step aside. Why? It\\u2019s your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain\\u2019t letting it drown me. You\\u2019ll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days\\u2019 time\\u2026 Greyjoy! We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen\\u2019s Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword. Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes. It grieves me you\\u2019ve less honour than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people. They are not my people. King Robb thought of you as a brother. My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you. Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons. Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home. If he were alive to see this\\u2026 He\\u2019s not. He\\u2019s dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine. I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand. You\\u2019ve served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I\\u2019ll\\u2026 Take him to the cells. Lock him up\\u2026 My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay. I\\u2019ll lock him in a cell until he rots. No, he has to pay the iron price. They\\u2019ll never respect you while he lives. Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death! No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded. The old man couldn\\u2019t keep his mouth shut. I urge you not to make a hasty decision. He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine. He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do. You\\u2019ll address me as Prince Theon or you\\u2019ll be next. Come. No! No! Theon! Rodrik! He who passes the sentence should swing the sword. I\\u2019m begging you. Coward. Stop. Stop! Stop right now! You don\\u2019t give commands any more, little lord. Please, stop this. Please stop him. Hush now, child. I\\u2019m off to see your father. You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please. Any last words, old man? Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost. Theon, please don\\u2019t. Do something! I\\u2019ll do anything, please! No, please stop it! Ghost, stay with us. Ghost! There goes your pet. He\\u2019s not a pet. No, you\\u2019re right, he\\u2019s not. You can\\u2019t tame a wild thing. You can\\u2019t trust a wild thing. Ghost is different. So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you\\u2019ll never know them. Now the wildlings we\\u2019re looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night. I thought you said you couldn\\u2019t know wild things. I said you can\\u2019t. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun\\u2019s up and do their killing when it\\u2019s dark. We could do the same. No, we couldn\\u2019t. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I\\u2019ve lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn\\u2019t see till they were in it. My father always said I\\u2019m of the North. I wasn\\u2019t joking. Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me? No, you don\\u2019t. We\\u2019re at war. We\\u2019ve always been at war. It\\u2019s never going to end \\u2019cause we\\u2019re not fighting an enemy. We\\u2019re fighting the North, and it\\u2019s not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life. I\\u2019ll gladly give my life. I don\\u2019t want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart\\u2019s done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They\\u2019ll never know what you\\u2019ve done. They\\u2019ll never know how you died. They won\\u2019t even know your damn name. But they\\u2019ll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me? I do. You\\u2019re even dumber than you look. It\\u2019s just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we\\u2019ve got a purpose. Come on. We\\u2019ve got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us. Can you read? My lord? Can you read? This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand. My apologies, my lord. I must have\\u2026 Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It\\u2019s the one on this\\u2026 My cupbearer can read better than you. To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance? My lord, I\\u2026 To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have , men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son\\u2019s life at risk again, I\\u2019ll\\u2026 Leave us. Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you\\u2019re about it. Lord Petyr Baelish. Mmm. Give us the room. Clear all this. Lord Tywin. Baelish. Wine? Thank you. What news from the capital? I travelled here directly from Renly Baratheon\\u2019s camp. Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear. So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces. Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel. It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after. You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today? After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers. Yes, yes, yes. The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly\\u2019s death. And Margaery\\u2026 Wants to be queen. Yes, she does. House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson. They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated. More wine for Lord Baelish. If you will allow me to represent your family\\u2019s interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement\\u2026 The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden? They have. Pardon, my lord. It\\u2019s only wine. You would ride there yourself? Tonight, with your leave. I\\u2019ll have an answer by nightfall. That\\u2019ll be all, girl. And what else? On your son Tyrion\\u2019s directive, I met with Catelyn Stark. Why? He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters. Hmm. A girl. A wildling. We could question her. You could. She won\\u2019t answer. I\\u2019ve known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking. What\\u2019s your name? Ygritte. She was reaching for this axe when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she\\u2019ll bury it in your face. I gave you my name. I\\u2019m Jon Snow. You ought to burn them you killed. We\\u2019d need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area? Burn them or maybe you\\u2019ll need those swords again. Our boy here\\u2019s already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass? The free folk. How many? Hundreds and thousands. More than you\\u2019ve ever seen, crow. Why come to the mountains? What\\u2019s in the Frostfangs your king could want? Do you mean to march on the Wall? Do you know who I am, girl? Qhorin Halfhand. Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner? They\\u2019d take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they\\u2019d kill you slow. We have no food for her. Can\\u2019t spare a man to watch her. Can\\u2019t let her go. She\\u2019ll bring Mance Rayder\\u2019s army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it? No. No, I\\u2019ll do it. Come, brothers. We\\u2019ll leave him to it. We\\u2019ll meet you at the top. Don\\u2019t take too long. We\\u2019re deep in their country now. You never killed a woman before, did you? You don\\u2019t need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There\\u2019s secret ways. The crows would never catch us. I\\u2019m as much a crow as they are. Will you burn me? After? Can\\u2019t. Someone might see the smoke. Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I\\u2019ll come back and haunt you. That\\u2019s cold. Go on. Be quick about it. Do it. Bastard, do it! You can\\u2019t do it. We both know it. The sun\\u2019s going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close. I\\u2019ll find them. Call for them. Go on. Call loudly. May the Seven guide the princess on her journey. May the Mother give her health. May the crone give her wisdom. May the warrior give her courage. One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it\\u2019s like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you. You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don\\u2019t cry. I saw you cry. Did you say something, my lady? My little brother cried when I left Winterfell. So? It seems a normal thing. Is your little brother a prince? No. Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog. Hail Joffrey! Hail to the King. Seven blessings on you, Your Grace. Murderer! Bastard! All hail the king. He\\u2019s no king. He\\u2019s a bastard! Please, Your Grace, we\\u2019re hungry. Freak. Get the prince back to the Keep now. Yes, my lord. Come, quickly. Please, Your Grace, give us some food! Bread, Your Grace, please! Who threw that? I want the man who threw that. Find who did that and bring him to me! Hold on! Hold them back! Just kill them! Kill them all! Move. Move! Pull back! Tear him to pieces! What are you doing? I want these people executed! And they want the same for you. Where\\u2019s Sansa? Through the door. Come on. Push hard. Protect the king! Get back! Fall back! Keep him safe! Brotherfucker! Watch out. Hold them back. Hey. Traitors! I\\u2019ll have all their heads. You blind, bloody fool. You can\\u2019t insult me. We\\u2019ve had vicious kings and we\\u2019ve had idiot kings, but I don\\u2019t know if we\\u2019ve ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king. You can\\u2019t\\u2026 I can, I am. They attacked me! They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They\\u2019re starving, you fool. All because of a war you started. You\\u2019re talking to a king! And now I\\u2019ve struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl? Let them have her. If she dies, you\\u2019ll never get your Uncle Jaime back. You owe him quite a bit, you know. Where are you going? You ever been fucked, little girl? Come here. Take some men and go and find the Stark girl. I take my orders from the king. Where? This way. Please! No! No! Please! You\\u2019re all right now, little bird. You\\u2019re all right. We\\u2019ll get you. We\\u2019ll get you. This way. Are you hurt, my lady? The little bird\\u2019s bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage. See to that cut. Well done, Clegane. I didn\\u2019t do it for you. He shouldn\\u2019t make me wait. The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth. I already have a husband. Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful. And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery. I have travelled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery. The Mother of Dragons! Here he comes. Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself. Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself. Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I\\u2019ll have them flogged in the square. Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want. Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want? My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. I fear I\\u2019m no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have. I\\u2019m not asking you for the kingdoms. I\\u2019m asking you for ships. I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another. Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne. Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne? My father sat there, before he was murdered. But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say \\u201ctake the Iron Throne\\u201d? I didn\\u2019t come here to argue grammar. Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army? Not yet. You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros? There are many there that support my claim. When were you there last? I left when I was a baby. So, in truth, you have no allies. The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return. Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you\\u2019ll pardon me. Do you know Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we\\u2019ve met. A shrewd man. For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed\\u2026 The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons. Do you understand? I\\u2019m no ordinary woman. My dreams come true. I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I\\u2019m sorry, little princess. I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it. Yes, my lady, but not with my ships. Who taught you to read? My father, my lord. Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn\\u2019t learning. He couldn\\u2019t make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he\\u2019d heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he? A stonemason. A stonemason who could read? Hmm. He taught himself. Quite a man. What killed him? Loyalty. You\\u2019re a sharp little thing, aren\\u2019t you? Did\\u2026 Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn\\u2019t ask questions. No. But you\\u2019ve already begun. Did you know your father, my lord? I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old. He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I\\u2019m cold. I\\u2019ll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord. Mmm. Where are you going, girl? The armoury, my lord. Why? Lord Tywin sent me. What might this be? Lord Tywin gave it to me. What for? To take to the armoury. Why would he do that? Let\\u2019s go and ask him. Move! Get out of the way! Amory Lorch. A girl has named a second name. A man will do what must be done. Now! A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time. But he\\u2019s going to tell Tywin. He\\u2019s getting away. It has to be now. Guard! Your Grace. Your Grace. My honour, Your Grace. Your Grace. Your Grace. Quent. Lady Talisa. Your Grace. I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019m a lady. Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me. It\\u2019s hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she\\u2019s a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows. Why are you so sure I\\u2019m of noble birth? Because it\\u2019s obvious. What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother and I lived with him above our shop? I\\u2019d call you a liar. Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty. I always thought I was a brilliant liar. Better at amputations, I\\u2019m afraid. Quite a pretty spot. Will we be here long? I couldn\\u2019t really discuss troop movements with you. I\\u2019m not a spy. Of course, a spy would deny being a spy. You\\u2019re right. You\\u2019ve found me out. I\\u2019m writing a letter to the Lannisters. \\u201cThe young wolf is on the move. \\u201d Perhaps you\\u2019d join me. If you\\u2019ve got time, of course, for, well\\u2026 Robb. Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She\\u2019s been helping with the wounded. She\\u2019s been very helpful. Lady Talisa. Lady Stark. Lady Talisa\\u2026 Maegyr. Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name. An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace. I\\u2019ve missed you. Yes, you look positively forlorn. You surprised me, that\\u2019s all. I didn\\u2019t think I\\u2019d see you today. I wish that you were free to follow your heart. I know. You have inherited your father\\u2019s responsibilities. I\\u2019m afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another. I know. A debt that must be paid. I haven\\u2019t forgotten. Your Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell. Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go. We\\u2019ll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today. Here? There\\u2019s no shelter here. There\\u2019s no shelter anywhere. There is\\u2026 if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire\\u2026 No fire. But a fire is\\u2026 No fire. Have it your way. We\\u2019ll stay warmer if we stay close. Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life. Think they\\u2019re out looking for you? Yes. Think they\\u2019ll find you? Yes. You\\u2019re brave. Stupid, but brave. We start again at first light. Get some sleep. Stop moving. I\\u2019m just trying to get comfortable. Stop it! You\\u2019re still moving. Was I? I didn\\u2019t notice that time. This cannot be true. We\\u2019ve had ravens from White Harbour, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I\\u2019m afraid it is true. Why? Why would Theon\\u2026 Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores. My brothers? We\\u2019ve heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead. I told you, never trust a Greyjoy! I must go north at once. There\\u2019s still a war to win, Your Grace. How can I call myself king if I can\\u2019t hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can\\u2019t\\u2026 You are a king. And that means you don\\u2019t have to do everything yourself. Let me go and talk to Theon. There will be no talk. He will die for this. Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you\\u2019ll lose what you gained. My boy would be honoured to bring you Prince Theon\\u2019s head. Tell your son Bran and Rickon\\u2019s safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I\\u2019ll take his head myself. Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you? I\\u2019m no liar. All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone. I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord. How? And don\\u2019t tell me to put a spear in your hand. There are other ways to serve, my lord. I\\u2019m a prince now, and you\\u2019d do well\\u2026 There are other ways to serve, my prince. Like what? We know things, the free people. You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt? Other things. Savage things. Wait outside. I always wondered what you had under there. It comes at a price. I\\u2019m not killing you. That\\u2019s your price. I already had that. What do you want then, other than your miserable life? What all free people want. My freedom. Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well. Ow! Shh. It\\u2019s not deep. I thought they were going to kill me. They thought so, too. He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me. Of course he did. Why? Why would a stranger\\u2026 You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn\\u2019t matter now. He\\u2019s dead. I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them. Don\\u2019t say these things. If the wrong people hear you\\u2026 But you\\u2019re not the wrong people. Don\\u2019t trust anybody. Life is safer that way. And where are you going? I have something for you from Prince Theon. What? Me. He says I\\u2019m to make the rounds. And keep you warm. The Spice King refuses me because I\\u2019m a bad investment. The Silk King won\\u2019t support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat? When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honourable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets. Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi. Where are they? Where are my dragons?\",\n          \"How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass? Depends if he\\u2019s had any practice. That the sort of thing you and your sister go in for? She loosened you up for us? He\\u2019s going to fall. He\\u2019s going to fall off his horse. Help him. Water. Water. Please, water. Water. Water, please. Please. Please. If I die, you won\\u2019t be getting\\u2026 Oh, enough. Here. Can\\u2019t say that I\\u2019ve ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast. Stop! Far enough. Do that again and I\\u2019ll take your other hand. Come on, you. Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in. I hope we might speak in confidence. Oh. Always in confidence. About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time? Oh, no, it\\u2019s a wonderful time. I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister\\u2019s intentions to\\u2026 End your life? I didn\\u2019t inherit Littlefinger\\u2019s spies along with his position, I\\u2019m afraid. Which is why I\\u2019m coming to you. I need proof. Proof? Will there be a trial? I need to know. I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still? I don\\u2019t know. Do I? As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I\\u2019d heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue, and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror\\u2019s trick? I don\\u2019t know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his red priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts. Yes. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed, which will require a degree of influence, which\\u2026 You do not possess at the moment. But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer\\u2019s purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief, and soon learned that the contents of a man\\u2019s letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the Small Council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world, where I managed to wrap them around something very special. Ugh. The sorcerer. Hello, my old friend. It\\u2019s been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time, if you have the stomach for it. When people talk about the Night\\u2019s Watch, they never mention the shovelling. Or the shit. They tell you about honour, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shovelling really is most of it. And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that. But when you\\u2019re not getting attacked or killed, usually you\\u2019re shovelling. Ah, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of me day. We need to get out of here. When the Lord Commander says we go, we go. The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How\\u2019d that turn out for us? He had no way of knowing. We do now. We know what\\u2019s out there. Craster\\u2019s been out here surviving. So he\\u2019s your new protector now? Our good friend Craster? We\\u2019re like the sons he never had. Mormont isn\\u2019t gonna save you. This lummox here isn\\u2019t gonna save you. When the Walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live, we\\u2019ll have to look out for ourselves. You woke him. I\\u2019m sorry. He\\u2019s beautiful. Shh! He\\u2019s beautiful. Does he have a name? No. Are you going to give him one? Why? Here. Gilly. You said to hold it for you until you came back. You\\u2019re back. I wanted you to have it. I don\\u2019t want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby\\u2019s life. Can you do that? Can you? I don\\u2019t have time for you. I don\\u2019t have time for anyone but him because he doesn\\u2019t have much time. You have to go after him. How? You know how. Brandon. Mother. How many times have I told you? No climbing. Mother, I need to find it. It\\u2019s here. It\\u2019s calling me. I want you to promise me. No more climbing. Promise me. Promise me! Promise me! Mother! Mother! Promise me, Bran! Promise me! Is he very large? No larger than usual, apparently. And yet, they said that he was\\u2026 Extraordinary. The most extraordinary man they\\u2019ve ever had. And they\\u2019ve had a lot of men. We\\u2019re talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion\\u2019s service? Seems a bit simple? What did he do to them? I don\\u2019t know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive. So what did they say? They said it was hard to describe. Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income? He was too preoccupied to notice. He\\u2019s leaving for the Eyrie soon. I\\u2019m helping him prepare for his journey. Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark? He hasn\\u2019t spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. Hmm. But I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019s lost interest. What makes you say so? His shipboard inventory. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession. Former profession. Of course. I\\u2019m missing something obvious you\\u2019re about to point out? Two featherbeds. He\\u2019s bringing two featherbeds for the cabin. Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed, besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls? He\\u2019s not interested in them, my lord. How do you know? Because I\\u2019m one of his girls. Prodigies in odd places indeed. Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather, his dragon. It ate her while her son watched. What\\u2019s left of her is buried in the crypts right down there. The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats comfortably. There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else. There aren\\u2019t more than people of any importance. No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats. Over there, in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. Aerion Brightflame, they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon. He was wrong. And, of course, there\\u2019s the Mad King, killed by my uncle. Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried? Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn\\u2019t find all this a bit macabre? No, it\\u2019s quite all right, Your Grace. I\\u2019d love to see their tombs, really. It\\u2019s like taking a walk through history. The tomb\\u2019s just up here. This is so exciting. You were married here, Your Grace? Yes. Must seem like only yesterday. Hmm. Seems like a lifetime ago. Your husband was buried here as well? No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm\\u2019s End. Such a tragedy. A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don\\u2019t mix. I should say not. My son\\u2019s a hunter. It helps him forget he\\u2019s never been within a mile of a real battle. I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm\\u2019s End for the better part of a year. All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent. I told him to stay out of Robert\\u2019s Rebellion. He had no business fighting an actual warrior. We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave. But they do seem to yearn for it. We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off, like rain off a wing. And yet the world belongs to them. A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind. The Gods have seen fit to make it so. My father didn\\u2019t want them here. He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise. I\\u2019m glad he did. I\\u2019m sorry, Your Grace. I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this. Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness. I couldn\\u2019t agree more. Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousand fold. I\\u2019ve spoken with them. I know how they feel about you. You led the defence of King\\u2019s Landing. They adore you. Open the doors. Joffrey. Wait. Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery! Bless you, Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery! Lady Margaery! Margaery! Long live Lady Margaery! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! King Joffrey! Gods bless King Joffrey! How far is it to Deepwood Motte? Not far, my lord. Your sister is waiting for you there. She sent you to save me? Yes. I served them, the men who were torturing you. I did what they told and waited. Why would you risk your life for me? I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord. I was only a boy when they took you away. My father brought us up to the bluffs so we could watch you carried off. I remember the look on my father\\u2019s face when he told us, \\u201cThat\\u2019s Balon Greyjoy\\u2019s last living son. \\u201d And those are the words I heard over again when I saw what they were doing to you. Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me. Did he? I don\\u2019t know, my lord. They\\u2026 They never told me much. My sister\\u2019s men are loyal to her. We don\\u2019t need to hide from them. Not all those are your sister\\u2019s men. Some of them are loyal to your father. Hmm. What is it? I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place. What did he tell you to do? Raid fishing villages. He didn\\u2019t trust me. Thought I was a Stark. I could never be a Stark. Robb Stark always reminded me of that. He lorded it over you? Didn\\u2019t have to. All he had to do was be. Be who he was born to be. His life fit him better than his clothes. How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? He\\u2019s the King in the North. And me\\u2026 My father gave me a choice and I made it. I could never be a Stark. But ironborn, that\\u2019s what I was born to be. I paid the iron price for Winterfell. I murdered those boys. The Stark boys? Never found them. Just some poor orphans living with a farmer. I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies, so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud. Maybe it\\u2019s not too late. It is. My real father lost his head at King\\u2019s Landing. I made a choice, and I chose wrong. And now I\\u2019ve burned everything down. Not everything, my lord. She\\u2019s up here. Yara. Shh! Wait. I brought him back. He\\u2026 He killed the others. What? No, I didn\\u2019t. You can\\u2019t! No! Please, stop! No! Put him back where he belongs. Eat. What are you doing? I\\u2019m dying. You can\\u2019t die. You need to live to take revenge. I don\\u2019t care about revenge. You coward. A little misfortune and you\\u2019re giving up. Misfor\\u2026 Misfortune? You lost your hand. My sword hand. I was that hand. You have a taste, one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them, and you whine and cry and quit. You sound like a bloody woman. I know what you did for me. You told them Tarth was full of sapphires. It\\u2019s called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water. You knew that. Why did you help me? You wanted to speak to me? Yes, about Jaime. What about him? I wanted to make sure we\\u2019re doing everything we can to get him back. When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner, what did I do in response? You started a war. And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir? Whatever you can. Whatever I can. You\\u2019re still here. Yes. Why? Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons? Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me. Years and years of lectures on family and legacy\\u2026 The same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations. Did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them, living by them? That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children? All right. Contribute. The Tyrells are a problem. The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. The Tyrells saved your life, your children\\u2019s lives. Margaery has her claws in Joffrey. She knows how to manipulate him. Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don\\u2019t distrust you because you\\u2019re a woman. I distrust you because you\\u2019re not as smart as you think you are. You\\u2019ve allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city. Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes. I will. Do you like it, Nana? Another golden rose. How original. I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses. I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear. \\u201cGrowing strong. \\u201d Ha! The dullest words of any house. \\u201cWinter is coming! \\u201d Now that\\u2019s memorable. \\u201cWe do not sow. \\u201d Strong. Strong. Those are houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts. But a golden rose growing strong, that strikes fear in the heart. Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along now. Grow strong. My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King\\u2019s Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence. The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me? A little obvious, perhaps. Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It\\u2019s been so long. Though I rather think it\\u2019s all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers. But you\\u2019ve come mincing all this way for something. So? Might I sit? No. Come, I\\u2019ve heard you\\u2019re such a clever man. I\\u2019m curious why you\\u2019ve sought me out. You\\u2019ve taken an interest in Sansa Stark. Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn\\u2019t I? She\\u2019s an interesting girl. Is she? No, not particularly. But she\\u2019s had an interesting childhood. She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then. I thought we shared certain hopes for her wellbeing. Come, come. You surrender rather easily. Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too. I choose my allies carefully, and my enemies more carefully still. Which is Sansa Stark? Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father. Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head? I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter. How? You\\u2019re not the only one who has taken an interest in her. That\\u2019s hardly surprising. She\\u2019s a beautiful girl with a famous name. Indeed. She\\u2019d make a lovely match for the right suitor. It almost feels as if you\\u2019re about to arrive at the point. Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him. And why have you come to me with this matter? Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army? Perhaps you\\u2019ll laugh, but I know him better than most, and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North. And if he marries her, he\\u2019ll have the key in his pocket. Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride? You must despise him. You\\u2019re working so hard to undermine him. Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes. You are a clever man, Lord Varys. You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution. One doesn\\u2019t need to be clever for that. It\\u2019s obvious, isn\\u2019t it? I didn\\u2019t mean to disturb you. You haven\\u2019t. We\\u2019d like some privacy, please. If you wouldn\\u2019t mind waiting back inside the keep. Or if you\\u2019d be kind enough to give me your names, I\\u2019ll ask the King to speak with you himself. What did you pray for? I can\\u2019t tell you. Why not? I\\u2019ll tell you what I prayed for in the Sept this morning. Let\\u2019s see, for my family\\u2019s health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter. Boring and traditional, I\\u2019m afraid. And you? I\\u2019m sorry, I just can\\u2019t. My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I\\u2019d ever seen. When I was , I was all elbows and knees, and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me. \\u201cPig Face,\\u201d she called me. \\u201cPig Face\\u201d? That\\u2019s ridiculous. It had something to do with my nose. Whenever she passed me in the halls, she\\u2019d oink. So I prayed that she\\u2019d catch a horrible skin disease. A week after that, she came down with porridge plague. Porridge plague? Oh, you don\\u2019t have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats, and eventually, your face slides off and you die in agony. But that\\u2019s awful. You\\u2019re\\u2026 I believed you! Porridge plague. I\\u2019m an idiot. Don\\u2019t say that. No, you\\u2019re not. So what happened to Alanna? Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. It\\u2019s all terribly frustrating. I\\u2019m sure she\\u2019s jealous of you now. You\\u2019ll be married here in the capital, and she\\u2019ll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you\\u2019re queen. I want us to be friends, good friends. That would make me very happy. You must see Highgarden. You\\u2019d love it there. I know you would. We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon. You should see the costumes. People work on them for months. Uh, I don\\u2019t think the Queen would let me leave King\\u2019s Landing. The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I\\u2019ll be queen. And if you were to marry Loras, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn\\u2019t it? We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that? His name was Bannen. He was a good man, a good ranger. He came to us from\\u2026 Where did he come from? Down White Harbor way. He came to us from White Harbor. Never failed in his duty. He kept his vows the best he could. He rode far, fought fiercely. We shall never see his like again. And now his watch has ended. And now his watch has ended. Didn\\u2019t think a broke foot could kill a man. It wasn\\u2019t his foot that killed him. That bastard Craster starved him to death. Craster\\u2019s got his daughters to feed. You on his side? We can\\u2019t just show up and steal all his food. We\\u2019re brothers of the Night\\u2019s Watch, not thieves. The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine, and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow. He\\u2019s a bloody wildling. Never knew Bannen could smell so good. You have one son, don\\u2019t you, Mormont? I had my th. You ever meet a man with sons? And more daughters than I can count. I\\u2019m glad for you. Are you now? Me, I\\u2019ll be glad when you and yours have gone. As soon as our wounded are strong enough. Ah! They\\u2019re as strong as they\\u2019re gonna get. Them that\\u2019s dying, why don\\u2019t you cut their throats and be done with it? Or leave them if you\\u2019ve not the stomach, and I\\u2019ll sort them myself. Whose throat you gonna cut, old man? Wait outside. It\\u2019s cold outside and there\\u2019s nothing to eat. My wives gave you bread. There\\u2019s sawdust in the bread. You don\\u2019t like it, you go out there and eat the snow. I\\u2019d rather eat what you\\u2019ve got hidden away. I told you to wait outside. He\\u2019s sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die. I gave you crows enough. I\\u2019ve got to feed my women! You admit you\\u2019ve got a hidden larder? How else you make it through winter? Enough! Out! I am a godly man. You\\u2019re a stingy bastard! Bastard? Out with you, you little thief. And you! And you! Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies. I\\u2019ll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard. You are a bastard. A daughterfucking, wildling bastard. The Gods will curse us for this. By all the laws\\u2026 There are no laws beyond the Wall. Show us where he hides the food, or you\\u2019ll get the same as him. Unhand her. I shall have your head for this. Quickly. Quickly. What\\u2019s happening? I\\u2019m not going out there. No, we have to go. Now! Follow me. I know the best way. Come on. Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well! I\\u2019ll be cutting your throat one of these nights. Can I take this hood off yet? I do apologise, little lady, but it\\u2019s better for you if you don\\u2019t see where we\\u2019re going. Halt! What is it? Blackstrap rum. Ugh! Not easy finding molasses in wartime. I\\u2019d have some. Let\\u2019s go home. What is this place? Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling. You look like a bunch of swineherds. Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before. You\\u2019re still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier? No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier. Beric Dondarrion? You\\u2019ve seen better days. And I won\\u2019t see them again. Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren\\u2019t fighting in a war, you\\u2019re running from it. Last I heard, you were King Joffrey\\u2019s guard dog. But here you are , miles from home. Which of us is running? Untie these ropes and we\\u2019ll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants? Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert\\u2019s name. Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother\\u2019s alive. You\\u2019re fighting for ghosts. That\\u2019s what we are, ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can\\u2019t see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear, Lannister, Stark, Baratheon, you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood Without Banners will hunt you down. You found god? Is that it? Aye. I\\u2019ve been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who\\u2019s seen the things we\\u2019ve seen. If you mean to murder me, then get on with it. You\\u2019ll die soon enough, dog. But it won\\u2019t be murder, only justice. And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions, you call yourselves. At the Mummer\\u2019s Ford, girls of seven years were raped, and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched. I wasn\\u2019t at the Mummer\\u2019s Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door. House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne. Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime? Murder is a crime. I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelt them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don\\u2019t call me murderer and pretend that you\\u2019re not. You murdered Mycah. The butcher\\u2019s boy. My friend. He was years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer. Aye, he was a bleeder. You don\\u2019t deny killing this boy? I was Joffrey\\u2019s sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince. That\\u2019s a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away. Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes. You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat. So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here? Aye. She might be. But it\\u2019s me you\\u2019ll fight. The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price. And who knows? In years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus, all shall prosper. Is it done, then? They belong to me? It is done. It is done. She holds the whip. You hold the whip. This bitch has her army. Unsullied! Forward march! Halt! Tell the bitch her beast won\\u2019t come. A dragon is not a slave. You speak Valyrian? I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue. Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see! I am your master! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Dracarys. Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Lemmas\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"POS\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Proper_Nouns\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Named_Entities\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"NE_Words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":79}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Save DataFrame as csv (in Google Drive)\n","# Use this step only to save  csv to your computer's working directory\n","final_data_df.to_csv('processed_GOT_s1to3.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"aR2pgpnHPndn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732536861009,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":540,"user":{"displayName":"H.A.
