For this assignment, I decided to analyze and annotate the first three seasons of the TV series "Game of Thrones".
I chose to do this, as it is widely said that the writing of the final two seasons of GoT was not as good as that of the earlier seasons.
As such, it would have been nice to include all 8 seasons in this analysis, however due to time constraints, and the fact that I was
struggling to find the scripts of the later seasons in their raw form, I only analyzed the first 3 seasons for the time being.
My target audience (for an analysis involving all 8 seasons) would be people who would like to know more about how exactly the writing
of GoT changed over the years, and if it got *quantifiably* worse.

For each episode, I created a txt file with the script. The scripts were sourced from https://gameofthronesscripts.wordpress.com/.

The columns included in my final table are as follows:
- Filename
- Season
- Episode
- Text (raw script)
- Doc
- Tokens (Tokenized)
- Lemmas (Tokenized and lemmatized)
- POS (Parts of speech)
- Proper_Nounds
- Named_Entities (Named entity types)
- NE_Words (Named entity words)

I followed the template from the lab exercise quite closely most of the way. I also didn't actually do that much interpreting of the results
since I had to spend most of the time actually finding and formatting the data. This is something that I would definitely correct if I decide
to repeat this process for my final assignment when all 8 seasons are included.
